Answer the following question step-by-step:

"{question}"

If you know the answer then output it directly.

Otherwise, if you don't know the answer or think it is beyond then output a search query between {start_rag} and {end_rag} as follows:

{start_rag}[your search query here]{end_rag}

Use this format whenever you need to verify facts, obtain up-to-date information, or fill knowledge gaps.

Remember: Your output should be in the form of {start_rag}[your search query here]{end_rag} if you don't know or are uncertain/speculative about the answer. Otherwise, output the answer directly.
