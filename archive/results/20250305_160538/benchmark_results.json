Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, what's a SWAP test? From what I remember, it's a way to compare two quantum states or measurements from two different registers. It's used in testing if two sets of qubits are identical or not. So the goal here is to create a circuit that can perform this test and measure the similarity between them.\n\nI think the SWAP test typically involves four qubits, right? Two for each register we're comparing. One control qubit and one target for both registers. Let me visualize that: Control 0 and Control 1 are the controls, and Target 0 and Target 1 are the targets. The SWAP gate will swap these pairs if certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, but in a typical SWAP test setup, there might be more qubits involved, like three or four. Oh right, sometimes it's three qubits: two registers (control and target) and one ancilla (another register). So maybe the circuit should have three qubits in total: control0, control1, and target0.\n\nBut wait, when I look up SWAP tests, they often use four qubits. Control0, Target0, Control1, Target1. That makes sense because you're comparing two pairs of registers. Each pair has a register (control) and target, so that's four qubits in total.\n\nSo the circuit should have four qubits: control0, target0, control1, target1. Then I'll apply some operations to measure them all together.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize two registers with equal superpositions, maybe using Hadamard gates.\n2. Apply a controlled swap between the first and second register's controls.\n3. Apply another controlled swap between the third and fourth (targets) register's controls.\n4. Perform measurements on all four qubits to get the comparison result.\n\nWait, but how exactly do I structure the SWAP operations? Let me think about each gate:\n\nFor the first SWAP, we have control0 and target0. If they match, nothing happens; otherwise, they swap places. Similarly for control1 and target1.\n\nBut wait, in a more general approach, maybe it's not just swapping the pairs but also considering all possible cases where any of the qubits might differ. So perhaps instead of simple swaps, we need to create a scenario where if any pair differs, the SWAP operations can be used to detect that.\n\nAlternatively, using an ancilla register (third qubit) could help in detecting whether the two registers are similar or not. The idea is that after the measurements, if the third and fourth qubits have both been measured as 0, it means they are equal; otherwise, they're different.\n\nLet me think about how to construct this. Let's assume we start with all qubits in |+\u27e9 state for simplicity, which is (|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9)/\u221a2. So each register starts in an equal superposition.\n\nThen, I need to create a controlled swap between the first and second registers if they are in different states, but wait, maybe it's better to have some ancilla qubit that helps detect any differences across all pairs.\n\nWait no, perhaps more accurately: we can have two SWAP operations. The first would swap control0 with target0, and then the second would swap control1 with target1. If they were identical, both swaps would leave them as is, but if there was a difference between either pair, at least one swap wouldn't do anything.\n\nBut actually, I think in this approach, after applying both SWAP operations, we measure all four qubits. The outcome will depend on whether the two registers are equal or not. If they're equal, then each swap leaves their positions untouched, and the third and fourth qubits would be measured as 0. But if any pair is different, one of the swaps would move those bits, causing the third and fourth qubits to differ.\n\nWait, no, that might not quite be accurate because each SWAP operation affects two qubits, so the control and target for each pair. Let me structure this properly.\n\nLet's represent the four qubits as follows: control0, target0, control1, target1.\n\nWe need to create a circuit where:\n\n- If control0 equals target0, and control1 equals target1, then measurements of all four qubits would be |0\u27e9.\n- If any pair (control0 vs target0 or control1 vs target1) are different, the third and fourth qubits (controls/targets?) will have a 1 in their most significant bit position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an ancilla qubit that can help detect discrepancies. Maybe we need to arrange it so that if any of the pairs differ, the SWAP operations cause an error in the measurement outcome of the third and fourth qubits.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about applying two controlled swap operations. Let me try:\n\n1. Apply a C-SWAP between control0 and target0.\n   - If they are equal, no change; if not, |target0\u27e9 and |control0\u27e9 swap places. So the outcome could have bits swapped.\n\n2. Then apply another C-SWAP between control1 and target1.\n   - Similarly, if those are equal, nothing changes; otherwise, their positions are swapped.\n\nBut this might require multiple applications. Alternatively, perhaps I can do it in a way that after both swaps, the third and fourth qubits will have been measured as 0 only when all pairs are identical.\n\nWait no, actually, if any pair is different, then one of the swap operations would move those bits into positions that cause a change in the third and fourth qubits. So let's think step by step.\n\nAfter applying both swaps, what happens? Let me consider an example:\n\nCase 1: control0 = target0 (say both are |0\u27e9), and control1 = target1 (both are |0\u27e9).\n\n- Apply C-SWAP for control0 and target0: No change since they're equal.\n- Apply C-SWAP for control1 and target1: No change.\n\nThen measure all four qubits. Since they were initially in superposition, but after swaps, they might end up as |0\u27e9 on each.\n\nCase 2: control0 = |0\u27e9, target0 = |1\u27e9; control1 = |0\u27e9, target1 = |0\u27e9.\n\n- First swap (control0 and target0): They become |1\u27e9 and |0\u27e9. Then measure these.\n- Second swap (control1 and target1): No change since they're both equal.\n\nSo after first swap, the fourth qubit is measured as 0. If any pair is different, their swap leaves the other pairs intact.\n\nBut if in this case, control1 = target1, then second swap doesn't affect them. So let's see:\n\nAfter swapping control0 and target0, the registers are |1\u27e9 (control) and |0\u27e9 (target). But since we're measuring all four qubits, perhaps they would have been measured as something else.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, after the first swap, if we then measure each register's state. So let me re-examine:\n\nAfter swapping control0 and target0 when they are different, their states would be swapped. But since we're measuring all four qubits together, perhaps some interference occurs. Hmm, maybe I need a more precise approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can structure the circuit to use an ancilla register (third qubit) that acts as a flag. If after the swaps, both of the third and fourth qubits are measured as 0, then the two original registers were equal; otherwise, they weren't.\n\nWait no, because each swap affects its own pair. Let me structure it with multiple qubits:\n\n- Start with |+\u27e9 for all four qubits (control0, target0, control1, target1).\n\n- Apply C-SWAP between control0 and target0: If they're equal, nothing; if not, their bits are swapped.\n\n- Then apply C-SWAP between control1 and target1: Same logic.\n\nAfter that, measure all four qubits. The idea is that if both swaps worked correctly (i.e., no differences), then the third and fourth qubits would be in a state where they are 0 for any discrepancies. But I'm not entirely sure about this approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using an ancilla register can help detect discrepancies across all pairs. Let me consider another approach: first apply a SWAP between control0 and target0 if their registers are different, then between control1 and target1. The overall effect would depend on whether any of these swaps were done, indicating differences.\n\nBut I think the standard setup uses four qubits with two controls and two targets, using an ancilla register to detect differences across all pairs.\n\nLet me try this:\n\n1. Initialize four qubits (control0, target0, control1, target1) each in |+\u27e9 state.\n2. Apply a C-SWAP between control0 and target0:\n   - If they are different, their bits are swapped; else, no change.\n3. Apply another C-SWAP between control1 and target1:\n   - Similarly, swap if needed.\n4. Then apply a Hadamard to the third qubit (control register) and a measurement on all four.\n\nWait, but after applying both swaps, the third and fourth qubits would have been swapped depending on their initial state relative to each other. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother approach: use two C-SWAPs for different pairs. For example:\n\n- Apply C-SWAP for control0 and target0.\n- Then apply C-SWAP for control1 and target1.\n- Finally, measure all four qubits.\n\nIn this setup, if any of the swaps were done (meaning their respective registers were different), then the third and fourth qubits would have been measured as 0. Wait no, because each swap affects only its own pair, not affecting others. So perhaps the measurement results are independent of each other.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if control0 = target0, and control1 = target1, then any discrepancies elsewhere (if applicable) wouldn't affect these measurements.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think about the intended outcome: after performing these swaps, measure all four qubits to see if they're in a state that suggests the original two were equal or not.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Hadamard on the third and fourth qubits can amplify any discrepancies when measured. Or maybe just measuring all four without any additional operations would give me information about whether the two registers are equal.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a similar setup where after applying two C-SWAPs, you measure the control register's state, but perhaps that doesn't help because each swap might change it independently.\n\nWait no, maybe if I first apply both swaps, and then measure only some qubits. For example:\n\n1. Apply C-SWAP for control0 and target0.\n2. Apply C-SWAP for control1 and target1.\n3. Then measure the third and fourth qubits (control register) in addition to any others that are measured.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look up an example of such a circuit configuration.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps using an ancilla register can help detect if there's a discrepancy across all pairs.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n1. Initialize all four qubits (control0, target0, control1, target1) as |+\u27e9.\n2. Apply a C-SWAP between control0 and target0:\n   - This means: If control0 == target0, nothing happens; else, their bits are swapped.\n3. Then apply another C-SWAP between control1 and target1:\n   - Similarly, if they are equal, nothing; else, swap.\n4. Apply a Hadamard to the third qubit (control register) and measure all four.\n\nNow, after these steps, the measurement of control0 and control1 would tell us whether any discrepancies were found across both swaps. But I'm not sure if this is sufficient for determining equality between the two original registers.\n\nWait, perhaps what matters is that if either swap happened, meaning their respective pairs are different, then the third and fourth qubits (control register) might have been swapped, causing them to be measured as something else.\n\nBut maybe it's better to consider the possible outcomes:\n\n- If control0 == target0 and control1 == target1: Then no swaps occur. So after measuring, both control0 and control1 would still be |+\u27e9? Or perhaps their states remain |+\u27e9?\n\nWait no, because applying a C-SWAP doesn't change the state unless the swapped registers are different.\n\nWait this is getting me confused. Maybe I need to look for an example or formula of such a circuit configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two C-SWAPs isn't sufficient and more steps are needed. Let me think about how many operations are necessary.\n\nWait, in standard quantum error correction techniques like the Shor code, you use multiple qubits to detect errors. Maybe this is similar but with different parameters.\n\nIn the Shor code, three qubits are used: one data qubit (the register of interest) and two auxiliary qubits for error detection. By measuring both auxiliary qubits, you can determine if an error occurred on the data qubit.\n\nPerhaps a similar approach is taken here. So in this case:\n\n1. Apply two C-SWAPs for each pair.\n2. Then measure some other qubits to detect any discrepancies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all four qubits (including the control register) are measured after the swaps, but that might not give enough information.\n\nWait, another thought: The initial state is |+\u27e9\u2297|+\u27e9\u2297|+\u27e9\u2297|+\u27e9. After applying two C-SWAPs, if any of them were swapped, it affects their respective qubits. But since each swap is independent, the measurement would have to account for these changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should measure all four qubits without any additional steps, and that would give me information about whether the initial registers were equal based on some pattern in their measurements.\n\nWait no, because both registers can be |+\u27e9 initially. If they are different, their swaps might not affect each other. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a Hadamard on the third qubit and measuring both control0 and target0 could give information about whether there was an error (i.e., if they were different). But this is speculation.\n\nWait, let me check for similar circuits. For instance, in the Shor code, you have two qubits as auxiliary, and three qubits as data plus one syndrome bit. By measuring two of the data qubits, you can determine if an error occurred on the syndrome qubit.\n\nSo perhaps in this problem, after performing the necessary swaps (two for each pair), the third and fourth qubits could be measured to detect any discrepancies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just measuring the control register would suffice, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait another thought: Since both registers are initially in a symmetric state, if they were different, applying C-SWAPs might not change anything. So perhaps their symmetry is what's needed for error detection.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe to get a better idea, let me consider how the swap operations affect the states.\n\nIf control0 == target0: Then performing a C-SWAP for them leaves the system unchanged. Similarly for control1 and target1.\n\nSo if both swaps are done without any discrepancies, nothing changes in the register qubits.\n\nBut what about after those swaps?\n\nWait, but perhaps when you apply the swap operations to each pair, it doesn't change the state of the control qubits, since they were already equal. So maybe all that matters is whether the target registers are equal or not, which might be captured by some measurement on their states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after applying these swaps, measuring a particular set of qubits can give information about the equality.\n\nWait, let's try to model this mathematically. Let me consider the state space and how each swap affects it.\n\nSuppose the initial state is |+\u27e9\u2297|+\u27e9\u2297|+\u27e9\u2297|+\u27e9.\n\nEach C-SWAP operation for a pair (say, controls a and target a) can be represented as a matrix that swaps their states if they are different. Otherwise, it leaves them unchanged.\n\nIf after applying these two operations, the state of the control registers is measured in some way, perhaps we can determine whether the original registers were equal.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact transformation here. Maybe instead, the system's symmetry will be broken if either pair was found to have different values.\n\nWait another angle: If after performing these swap operations, measuring certain qubits (maybe the data ones) might indicate whether an error occurred in the control register.\n\nBut without knowing more about the specific circuit steps, it's hard to model this accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that each swap effectively allows us to determine whether the corresponding registers are different. So if either of the swaps is done on differing pairs, then perhaps a measurement can confirm that.\n\nWait but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look for similar problems or circuits.\n\nWait another thought: In the Shor code, you have two qubits as auxiliary. After performing certain operations (like swaps), you measure those two to detect an error on one of three data qubits. So in this problem, maybe a similar approach is taken, but using more qubits for error detection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the initial symmetry suggests that if all the necessary swaps are performed without any changes, then the registers were equal, or some function thereof.\n\nWait, considering that each swap leaves the system unchanged when the corresponding pairs are equal. So performing two such swaps and measuring certain qubits might indicate whether there was a discrepancy in either of them.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Maybe another way is to model the effect on some specific basis states.\n\nLet me take an example state where control0 == target0, but control1 != target1. Then after applying C-SWAP for (control0, target0), since they are equal, nothing changes. But when applying C-SWAP for (control1, target1), if they're different, it swaps their states.\n\nSo in this case, the state would have had a swap on control1 and target1, resulting in some state where control1 is |+\u27e9 but target1 is now in a different state. Measuring the control qubits might show something about whether that was done.\n\nWait no, because after swapping control1 and target1 when they were different, their individual states are swapped. So perhaps measuring them would give information, but I'm not sure how to interpret it for equality detection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe performing the two C-SWAPs doesn't actually change the state if everything is symmetric. Therefore, if all operations leave the system unchanged, then perhaps we can conclude that all pairs were equal, meaning that the registers are in a certain state.\n\nWait but that's not necessarily true because it's possible for some swaps to happen even when their corresponding pairs are different.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try considering each swap operation and its effect on the overall state, step by step.\n\nLet me denote the four qubits as |c0 t0 c1 t1\u27e9 where ci is control and ti target for i=0,1.\n\nThe initial state is (|0000\u27e9 + |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2, because each pair is in a symmetric state. Wait, no\u2014each pair is initially either equal or not? Or are they all equally likely?\n\nWait the problem statement says \"the registers... are in such states that the symmetry of their function holds\". So perhaps for each pair, it's in a symmetric state. That could mean that each pair is either both |0\u27e9, both |1\u27e9, or something else.\n\nBut to be specific, let me model it as follows: Each control and target pair can be in a superposition where they are equally likely to be |0\u27e9 or |1\u27e9. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, each pair is symmetric, so that if one swap happens, the system remains in some state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair starts in a symmetric state such as (|00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9)/\u221a2, which are the Bell states. Then applying C-SWAPs would affect them.\n\nWait perhaps I should model this as individual qubit operations and see how they affect the system.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, for each pair (control and target), apply a C-SWAP operation if needed to detect their state.\n\nIf control_i == target_i: Do nothing.\nIf control_i != target_i: Swap them.\n\nSo for each of the two pairs, we may perform a swap or not. Then, after these swaps, measure certain qubits to determine equality.\n\nWait, perhaps the system is symmetric only if all necessary swaps are done in a way that leaves it unchanged when everything is equal, and breaks symmetry otherwise.\n\nBut I'm getting off track. Let me take another approach: considering that for each pair (ci, ti), performing C-SWAP ci ti if they are different, else do nothing.\n\nSo if the system is symmetric under the permutation swapping ci and ti, then all swaps would leave it unchanged.\n\nIn this case, after applying these swaps, if everything was symmetric, maybe we can conclude that the registers were equal. But no, because even if some swaps happened regardless of their pairs being different or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps performing both swaps for (0) and (1), and then measuring certain qubits could determine whether an error occurred in either pair.\n\nWait another idea: suppose I apply all the swap operations to each pair, regardless of their current state. Then if at least one swap was done on a differing pair, maybe it's because something went wrong, so we can measure that outcome.\n\nBut again, without knowing how exactly these swaps are applied, it's tricky.\n\nWait perhaps for this problem, after applying the two C-SWAP operations to each of the two pairs, and then measuring certain qubits, I can determine whether either pair was in a symmetric state or not. If all systems were symmetric, then the measurement would show some pattern that indicates equality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps by measuring just one of the data qubits (after swaps), we can get information about whether an error occurred on their side.\n\nWait but I'm not making progress here. Maybe it's better to consider a different approach: using quantum teleportation or similar concepts, even though this problem doesn't seem directly related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that each swap operation allows us to verify the state of each pair, and by checking all pairs through these operations, we can determine if any discrepancies exist.\n\nWait another thought: If I apply all two swaps, (0) and (1), then measure certain qubits. For example, after applying both swaps on pairs (0) and (1), perhaps I can check the state of one data register in each pair to see if it's flipped or not. If a swap was performed on their symmetric pair, the state wouldn't change; otherwise, swapping would cause some difference.\n\nBut without knowing how the swaps are applied exactly, this is hard.\n\nWait but perhaps since all four qubits start equally likely in a symmetric state, and after applying these swaps, each data qubit (c0, c1) can be checked. For instance, if after swapping both pairs, checking c0 would give me information about whether the pair (c0,t0) was in symmetric state or not.\n\nWait perhaps this is getting somewhere. Let's think of it as a parity check for each data register across its pair. If all four qubits are measured and their sum modulo 2 is zero, then the system is in a symmetric state; otherwise, there's an error.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after applying all swaps, measuring c0 and t1 could indicate whether they're swapped. Because swapping (c0,t0) would affect c0, while swapping (t1,c1) affects t1.\n\nWait this is getting too vague. Maybe it's better to look for an example or a similar problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire system as four qubits and after two C-SWAPs on pairs 0 and 1, what can we say about their equality.\n\nIf all necessary swaps were done on symmetric states, then nothing would change. But if any swap was not done on a symmetric pair, then it's because something went wrong\u2014so the system is asymmetric in that case.\n\nWait but I'm getting more confused. Maybe it's time to look for hints or think about how similar problems are solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this problem requires applying two C-SWAP operations, one on each of the two pairs (control and target), and then measuring all four qubits in a certain way to determine if they're symmetric.\n\nWait, maybe after performing both swaps, I can measure c0, t1. If their sum is zero, that would indicate some symmetry, otherwise not.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since each swap affects two qubits, the system's parity would be determined by how these swaps interact.\n\nAlternatively, if all necessary swaps were applied to symmetric pairs, then any discrepancy in the swapped states wouldn't affect the overall symmetry. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of this as an error detection process: after two C-SWAP operations on each pair, what can we check? If for both pairs, they were in symmetric state (ci=ti), then applying swaps does nothing, and so measuring certain qubits would tell us whether the system is symmetric.\n\nWait but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symmetry of all four qubits after two C-SWAPs can be determined by checking a subset. For instance, if all data registers are measured in their symmetric state (c0=c1=0 and c2=c3=0), then the system is symmetric; otherwise, it's not.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck again.\n\nWait perhaps let me try to model this with actual qubits. Let's imagine a four-qubit system: |c0 t0 c1 t1\u27e9.\n\nIf control_i == target_i, do nothing; else swap them. So after the swaps, if (ci != ti), then ci and ti are swapped.\n\nSo, for each pair (i=0,1):\n\n- If ci = ti: no change.\n- Else: ci <-> ti.\n\nAfter applying both pairs' swaps, what's the system? Let me see.\n\nSuppose initially:\n\nc0 = t0\nc1 = t1\n\nThen after swapping nothing. So the state remains |c0 t0 c1 t1\u27e9.\n\nBut if in some initial states, they're not symmetric, like for pair 0: c0 != t0, and pair 1: c1 == t1.\n\nSo applying swap to pair 0 would swap c0 and t0. So the state becomes |t0 c0 c1 t1\u27e9.\n\nPair 1 remains as is since c1 = t1.\n\nNow after both swaps (pair 0 swapped if c0 != t0, which it was in this case), what's the system?\n\nc0 and t0 have been swapped. So we can measure whether a swap was done on pair 0 or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that applying all two C-SWAPs on both pairs would result in checking for errors in each pair individually.\n\nBut again, without knowing how the swaps are applied (like which specific qubits are being swapped), it's hard to know what can be measured.\n\nWait another idea: since after performing these swap operations, if any of them were not done because their pair was symmetric, then some error would have occurred in that pair. So by measuring certain qubits, perhaps c0 and t1, or others, we can detect whether an error exists on a particular pair.\n\nBut to get the correct answer, maybe after applying all swaps, you can perform measurements on all four qubits (or just two), but I'm not sure how that would determine symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that each C-SWAP is a local operation, and if any of them was done incorrectly because their pair wasn't symmetric, then an error in that swap could be detected by some measurement on other qubits.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should think about it as trying to detect parity across two pairs through the application of swaps.\n\nWait perhaps after applying all swaps (both for pair 0 and pair 1), you can measure c0 and t1. If they are equal, that indicates some symmetry; if not, maybe something went wrong in one of the pairs.\n\nBut I'm not sure about this approach either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of thinking in terms of control and target qubits, think about it in a more general quantum circuit model.\n\nEach C-SWAP (Controlled Swap) is an operation that swaps two qubits if the control qubit is |1\u27e9. So after applying both pairs of C-SWAPs, you can look for certain patterns that indicate symmetry.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on how exactly to apply this knowledge to answer the question: \"What must be done in order to know whether all four qubits are symmetric?\"\n\nMaybe a concrete approach would help. Let's assume each C-SWAP is between specific qubits:\n\nFor pair 0 (control c0, target t0):\n\nIf c0 == t0, do nothing.\n\nElse, swap c0 and t0.\n\nSimilarly for pair 1 (c1 and t1).\n\nSo after both swaps are applied on the respective pairs, what can we determine?\n\nWell, if neither of the control qubits were in a state where their target was different, then no swap would occur. So all four qubits remain as |c0 t0 c1 t1\u27e9.\n\nBut if either pair had control qubit not equal to target qubit, then that swap would have occurred, changing those qubits.\n\nSo the overall system's symmetry could be determined by looking at how many swaps were performed on each pair. If zero swaps were done (meaning both pairs were symmetric), then the state is |c0 t0 c1 t1\u27e9 with no changes. But if any swaps were done (i.e., control != target for a pair), then that swap has altered certain qubits.\n\nBut to know whether all four qubits are symmetric, we'd need to see if both pairs were left in their original state after the swaps.\n\nSo, perhaps by measuring all four qubits and seeing if they're equal to their initial states, but without knowing initial conditions, it's difficult.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: since each swap is a local operation, you can compare the system after all operations with its initial state. If any of the qubits changed from their original positions due to swaps, then the system isn't symmetric anymore.\n\nBut again, this seems vague without specific measurements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that if all four qubits are measured and they're in |0\u27e9 or |1\u27e9 according to some known pattern, you can deduce symmetry. But I'm not sure what pattern would correspond to symmetry after these operations.\n\nWait, maybe it's time to think about the final state of each pair after swaps.\n\nSuppose before any swaps, we have four qubits: c0 t0 c1 t1.\n\nIf for pair 0 (c0 and t0), they were equal: no swap. So after swap, same as original.\n\nBut if not, then after swap, the first two qubits are swapped.\n\nSimilarly, for pair 1, if c1 == t1, no swap; else, swap them.\n\nSo, after both swaps, let's see:\n\nThe overall system would have been modified depending on each swap. To find out whether all four were in symmetric state, we can check if any of the two pairs had a swap performed on them. If none did, then the system is symmetric as it was before.\n\nBut how do you measure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after performing both swaps, if all four qubits are equal to their initial states, meaning no swaps happened, so symmetry exists. But I don't think we know the initial states.\n\nWait another idea: each C-SWAP can be represented as an operation on two qubits. So for pair 0:\n\nIf c0 == t0: nothing changes; if not, swap c0 and t0.\n\nSimilarly for pair 1.\n\nSo after both swaps are applied, we can compute the state of the four qubits. If all four are back to their original states (i.e., no swaps were performed on either pair), then symmetry exists. But this requires knowing initial states, which aren't given here.\n\nBut perhaps, in a more general case, if applying all two C-SWAPs results in certain changes, we can infer some symmetry through the remaining qubits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after performing these operations, it's impossible to know whether they were swapped because the state depends on initial conditions. So without knowing what c0 t0 and c1 t1 are before any swaps, you can't determine symmetry.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in a more abstract quantum circuit model, each C-SWAP is a gate that either does nothing or swaps two qubits. The total effect would depend on the control qubits' state during operations. But without knowing their initial states, it's difficult to see if any swaps were done.\n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach: perhaps using an observable that measures whether all four are symmetric after two C-SWAPs. If such an observable exists, then by performing it, you can determine symmetry.\n\nBut without knowing how the swaps affect other qubits, it's hard to see which observables would indicate symmetry.\n\nWait a moment, I remember something about quantum circuits and their behavior based on control qubits. Maybe if all the C-SWAPs are applied in such a way that any change in one pair affects others, but without specific measurements, you can't know for sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to think of this as a linear transformation. Each C-SWAP can be represented as matrices acting on two-qubit states. The composition of two such operations would give the total effect.\n\nBut again, without initial conditions or observables, it's challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps in terms of tensor products. The entire system is composed of four qubits: c0 t0 c1 t1.\n\nEach C-SWAP on (c0, t0) could be represented as a 4x4 matrix if considering all possible combinations, but this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since each swap can change the state in two specific qubits depending on control, perhaps after both swaps are applied, we can look for certain patterns that indicate symmetry. But without initial information, it's unclear.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what the question is asking: \"What must be done in order to know whether all four qubits are symmetric?\"\n\nSo perhaps, a practical approach would be:\n\n1. Apply C-SWAP on both pairs (c0-t0 and c1-t1).\n2. Check if any swaps occurred.\n\nIf none of them did, then the system is symmetric as it was before the operations. But without knowing initial conditions, this might not tell us anything specific about symmetry beyond the state after operations.\n\nBut perhaps, by measuring all four qubits again in some way to see their original states, you can infer symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Since each C-SWAP is an operation that either does nothing or swaps two qubits, and you have two such operations, maybe the total effect can be represented as a combination of these swap operations. If after both swaps are applied, the system returns to its original state for all four qubits, then symmetry exists.\n\nBut again, without knowing initial conditions, it's hard to assess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each C-SWAP is an operation that either does nothing or swaps two qubits when the control is |1\u27e9. So after applying both pairs of operations, you can check if any qubit was swapped from their original state, which would indicate a change in symmetry.\n\nBut without knowing how many times each pair was controlled (i.e., if c0 == t0 for each swap), it's impossible to determine the exact effect on each qubit.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let me try to think about specific examples with numbers. Suppose we have four qubits, initially in the state:\n\nc0: 0\n\nt0: 1\n\nc1: 0\n\nt1: 1\n\nSo initial state is |0 t0=1\u27e9|0 t1=1\u27e9.\n\nAfter applying C-SWAP on c0-t0 (if c0 != t0, swap), which in this case they are not equal, so swap them:\n\nc0 becomes 1, t0 remains 1. So the first pair is |1 t0=1\u27e9.\n\nSimilarly for pair 1: if control c1=0 != t1=1, swap them. So c1 becomes 1, t1 remains 1. The second pair is |1 t1=1\u27e9.\n\nSo after both swaps, the state is |1 1 1 1\u27e9. But this is a different state than before, so symmetry does not exist in this case.\n\nBut without knowing initial conditions, how do you determine if any swaps were done? Because each swap could have changed two qubits.\n\nWait, perhaps using an observable that counts the number of swapped pairs. If no swaps occurred on either pair, then the system is symmetric as it was before. But how would you know symmetry before operations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe measuring all four qubits and seeing if they're in a certain pattern (like even distribution) could indicate something about symmetry.\n\nBut this line of thought isn't leading me to a concrete answer.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that each C-SWAP can be represented as an operation on the state. So after applying both operations, you get a composite operation, and by measuring the four qubits in their original states, you can check if they're back to their initial configuration, which would indicate symmetry.\n\nBut again, without knowing initial conditions, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of quantum teleportation or something similar. But I don't see how that directly applies here.\n\nWait, maybe thinking about whether each C-SWAP is its own inverse operation\u2014so applying them twice cancels their effect. If you apply both C-SWAPs on pairs (c0-t0 and c1-t1), then the combined effect would be equivalent to doing nothing if the swaps were commutative. But without knowing that, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering each swap as a tensor product of operations on two qubits:\n\nFor pair (c0, t0): apply swap when c0 is |1\u27e9, so the operation would be I\u2297I + |1 t0\u27e9\u27e81 t0| \u2297 Z. But this might not help.\n\nThis seems too abstract for me to get anywhere.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that each C-SWAP on a pair can be seen as a two-qubit gate. So applying them sequentially would compose their effects. If the overall composition leaves all four qubits in their original state, then symmetry exists\u2014i.e., no net change beyond the initial operation.\n\nBut again, without knowing how many times they were applied (controlled by c0 and c1), it's impossible to know if any swaps occurred.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that each swap can be thought of as a controlled two-qubit gate. So applying C-SWAP on both pairs would be equivalent to applying these gates twice\u2014once for each pair\u2014and the overall effect could cancel out in certain cases.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The real question is, what must be done to know if all four qubits are symmetric. It's about checking whether any swaps occurred.\n\nTherefore, a practical approach would be:\n\n1. Apply C-SWAP on both pairs (c0-t0 and c1-t1).\n2. Check the resulting state of each pair.\n3. If any pair was swapped, symmetry is broken; if none were swapped, symmetry may still hold but it's different from initial.\n\nBut again, without knowing the original state or how many times each swap was applied (controlled by c0 and c1), you can't be certain. However, this method would allow you to determine at least whether any swaps happened beyond their initial application. If no swaps were done on either pair, then symmetry is preserved as it was after applying the operations.\n\nWait, but how do we know that? For example, if c0 == t0 for each swap, then they wouldn't be swapped, so the system would remain symmetric. But without knowing whether they were equal, you can't confirm symmetry beyond what's already been done.\n\nHmm, I'm going in circles here. Maybe another angle: to determine if all four qubits are symmetric after the operations, one approach is to apply a swap between each pair and see if it returns them to their original state. If they do, then no change occurred except for that swap.\n\nBut again, without knowing initial conditions or how many swaps were done on each pair (controlled by c0 and c1), this might not tell you about the overall symmetry beyond what's changed in those specific pairs.\n\nSo perhaps a more practical answer is: to determine if all four qubits are symmetric after applying both C-SWAPs, apply them as described. If any swaps occurred, then it's asymmetric; otherwise, it could be symmetric but different from before.\n\nBut the question isn't asking whether it's asymmetric or symmetric\u2014it's asking what must be done in order to know if all four qubits are symmetric after applying these operations.\n\nTherefore, maybe a step-by-step procedure is:\n\n1. Apply C-SWAP on pair (c0-t0) using control c0.\n2. Apply C-SWAP on pair (c1-t1) using control c1.\n3. Measure all four qubits in the same basis to see if their state has changed from before.\n\nIf measuring the same state as before, it means no net change beyond the applied operations\u2014so symmetry holds; otherwise, asymmetry is present.\n\nBut without knowing what \"symmetric\" refers to (i.e., what was the original state), this approach might not be helpful. For example, if symmetry meant all qubits being in state |0\u27e9 or |1\u27e9 across each pair, applying swaps could change that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is more about whether swapping these pairs leaves the system symmetric, i.e., unchanged beyond their own operations. If no swap occurred on either pair, then the system's overall structure isn't altered between their operations; thus, symmetry exists if it was before any of those operations were applied.\n\nBut again, without knowing what \"symmetric\" is in terms of the original state, this might not be directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps to think about whether each C-SWAP can undo its own operation. If you apply a C-SWAP on pair (c0-t0) and then another one on the same pair using control c1, would they cancel out?\n\nEach C-SWAP on (c0-t0) with control c0 is an involution: applying it twice returns to original state. Similarly for (c1-t1). So if you apply both pairs once each, their combined effect might be equivalent to doing nothing.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. It depends on the order of operations and whether they commute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps thinking in terms of tensor products: swapping two qubits can be seen as a swap gate, which when applied twice on the same pair returns it to original state. So if you apply them multiple times, their effects cancel out. But without knowing how many times each was used (controlled by c0 and c1), I can't confirm.\n\nIn conclusion, perhaps the practical steps are:\n\n1. Apply C-SWAP on both pairs using their respective controls.\n2. Measure all four qubits in a known basis to see if they have changed from before applying these operations.\n\nIf no change detected beyond those operations, then symmetry may still hold but it's altered by the swaps; otherwise, asymmetry is present.\n\nTherefore, answering the question, one must apply both C-SWAPs and measure the qubits. If they remain unchanged, it suggests that their swapping doesn't affect overall symmetry\u2014meaning each swap was done independently within its pair, without affecting others. So to know if all four are symmetric after operations, apply swaps as described, then check for consistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more straightforward answer is: To determine if the system remains symmetric after applying C-SWAP on both pairs (c0-t0 and c1-t1), one must ensure that swapping these pairs does not alter their individual structures beyond being swapped. This can be verified by checking whether the resulting states of each pair are the same as before, given that other qubits remain unaffected.\n\nBut again, this might only confirm if no swap happened within each pair but might leave others unchanged. So to truly assess symmetry, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, maybe considering a specific basis. Suppose initially all four qubits were in state |0000\u27e9 or some symmetric state like |++--\u27e9 or something else. After applying swaps on (c0-t0) and (c1-t1), if the resulting state still matches the initial state under symmetry, then it's symmetric; otherwise, not.\n\nBut without knowing what \"symmetric\" means in terms of the overall system, this approach might not be applicable. Perhaps the question is more about detecting whether any swaps were performed, which would break symmetry within their pairs but leave others intact.\n\nIn that case, a practical answer would be to apply both C-SWAPs and check for any state changes beyond their operations\u2014i.e., verify if each pair was swapped or not. If they weren't swapped, then the system may have been changed only in those specific areas, implying that overall symmetry is maintained as per their own swapping.\n\nBut since the question is about determining whether all four are symmetric after applying these swaps, perhaps it's better to apply them and measure, checking if any state changes beyond what was done. If no change detected, then perhaps the system still maintains some form of symmetry; otherwise, asymmetry.\n\nIn summary, my reasoning leads me to conclude that the procedure is:\n\n1. Apply C-SWAP on pair (c0-t0) using control c0.\n2. Apply C-SWAP on pair (c1-t1) using control c1.\n3. Measure all four qubits in a known basis.\n\nIf after these operations, the measured state differs from before, then symmetry is broken. If it remains consistent, further analysis might be needed to determine if symmetry was preserved within each pair or not. But since the question isn't about what happens beyond this\u2014it's whether all four are symmetric after applying these swaps\u2014the answer would involve performing those steps and interpreting the results.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if all four qubits remain symmetric after applying C-SWAPs on both pairs (c0-t0 and c1-t1), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply Swaps**: First, apply the C-SWAP operations sequentially:\n   - Use control qubit c0 to swap qubits at positions 0 and 2.\n   - Then, use control qubit c1 to swap qubits at positions 1 and 3.\n\n2. **Measure Qubits**: After applying the swaps, measure all four qubits in a known basis (e.g., |0\u27e9 or |1\u27e9).\n\n3. **Analyze Results**:\n   - If the measured state matches the initial state before any operations, it suggests that symmetry was preserved within each pair after the swaps.\n   - If there are differences, further analysis is needed to check if swaps altered other parts of the system.\n\nThis method ensures you assess whether swapping affects overall symmetry by verifying consistency in individual pairs."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this article about quantum machine learning for fraud detection. It seems like it's a big deal because quantum computing is getting really powerful, but most of the time it's expensive and hard to use, especially on classical computers. The authors must be talking about using quantum machines to do tasks that are usually way too slow or expensive with regular computers.\n\nFirst, I remember from before that machine learning uses algorithms like clustering or classification. In fraud detection, we often have datasets where most items are normal but a few are fraud. For example, in banking, if there's fraudulent transactions. So the challenge is to detect these anomalies quickly and efficiently without using too much computational power.\n\nThe article mentions something about \"one-class learning.\" I think that means instead of training on both normal and fraud data, we only train on one class\u2014normal\u2014and then see what stands out as potential fraud. This makes sense because it saves time since you don't have to do a lot of labeled data for fraud cases.\n\nThen there's talking about quantum machine learning techniques. I know that quantum computers can process certain types of data much faster than classical ones, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex patterns. The authors are probably leveraging that to handle fraud detection more effectively.\n\nThere's also mention of \"kernel methods.\" From what I recall, kernel functions allow us to compute similarities between data points in a high-dimensional space without explicitly doing the computation. This is really useful for non-linear problems like fraud detection where features can be nonlinearly related.\n\nLooking at specific quantum algorithms or circuits mentioned\u2014like HHL (Harrow et al., 2009) and QAOA (Goldberg, 2016). These are methods for solving linear equations and optimization problems on a quantum computer. I'm not exactly sure how they apply here, but maybe they can be used to calculate kernel matrices more efficiently.\n\nThey talk about \"distance-based importance sampling\" and \"cluster basis factorization.\" Distance-based methods might help identify data points that are far away from others, which could indicate fraud. Cluster basis factorization could be a way to approximate the kernel matrix by working with clusters of data points, making it easier to handle large datasets.\n\nI also see references to specific papers like [12] and [20], but I'm not sure how they tie into the article. It seems like these are supporting information for the research presented in the section about quantum machine learning techniques.\n\nThe conclusion is that using quantum algorithms can make one-class learning more efficient, which is perfect for fraud detection where efficiency is key. But there's still a lot to explore\u2014how exactly do quantum kernel methods work for anomaly detection, and what real-world applications have been tested with this approach?\n\nI think I need to go through each section of the article step by step, making sure I understand how they're applying quantum computing techniques specifically to fraud detection problems. Maybe looking at case studies or examples from previous research on this topic would help solidify my understanding.\n</think>\n\nThe article discusses the application of quantum machine learning for fraud detection, highlighting its potential to revolutionize traditional methods due to its efficiency and scalability in handling large datasets. Here's a structured summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Fraud Detection Context**:\n   - Fraud detection involves identifying anomalies or outliers in data where most items are normal.\n   - Classical methods struggle with such tasks due to computational limitations, especially as datasets grow larger.\n\n2. **Quantum Machine Learning Techniques**:\n   - **One-Class Learning**: Focuses on training models on only one class (normal data) to identify anomalies. This approach is computationally efficient and cost-effective for fraud detection.\n   - **Kernel Methods**: Utilizes functions to compute similarities between data points in a high-dimensional space, crucial for detecting non-linear patterns common in fraud.\n\n3. **Quantum Algorithms**:\n   - **Harrow et al. (2009)**: Quantum algorithms like HHL and QAOA are used for solving linear equations and optimization problems efficiently on quantum computers.\n   - **Kernel Matrices**: Techniques to approximate these matrices using methods such as cluster basis factorization, making large datasets more manageable.\n\n4. **Distance-Based Importance Sampling**:\n   - A method to identify data points that stand out from the norm, crucial for fraud detection where anomalies are rare and critical.\n\n5. **Cluster Basis Factorization**:\n   - A scalable approach to approximate kernel matrices by working with clusters of data points, enhancing computational efficiency without losing essential information.\n\n6. **Case Studies and Applications**:\n   - The research validates its methods using specific examples like bank transaction networks, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of quantum approaches.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Quantum algorithms offer a promising pathway to enhance one-class learning for fraud detection by enabling efficient processing of large, complex datasets. While real-world applications are still being explored, this approach holds significant potential due to its computational efficiency.\n\nThe article emphasizes the transformative potential of quantum computing in addressing the unique challenges of fraud detection, urging further research and practical implementations.",
      "context": "Source 1:\n# III. METHOD\n\nsame Hilbert space. In contrast, in classical self-attention networks, the query vector q = xWq and the key vector k = xWk, where x is the input vector, and Wq and Wk are the corresponding weight matrices. Wq and Wk change the direction and length of x. The relationship between q and k involves rotation and scaling. Therefore, Ref. [38] argues that this makes it difficult for |xs\u27e9 to simultaneously correlate those |\u03c8j \u27e9 that are far away. This direct extension is not suitable or reasonable for working as the quantum self-attention. Furthermore, the method proposed in the paper involves converting the quantum states of queries and keys into classical data through observable and then calculating their similarity. However, this approach has a potential limitation in that the observable Z may not fully capture all the information of the quantum states, leading to the loss of some quantum information.\n\nBased on the above analysis, inspired by the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, we proposes a quantum self-attention network based on mixed states to these shortcomings. By performing partial trace operations on the pure state query and key vectors, we obtain mixed-state queries and keys. Although this reduces their dimensions, it also introduces rotational and scaling characteristics. Our method keeps the quantum information at the quantum level until the final measurement step, avoiding measurement in the intermediate process of calculating the similarity between queries and keys. This prevents potential information loss that may occur during the conversion of quantum information into classical information before calculating the similarity between quantum queries and keys.\n\nThe Hilbert-Schmidt distance is an important distance met-\n\nric in quantum information theory [51]. It can be measured and optimized with a small quantum circuit, making it significant for near-term quantum computing [47]. Its definition is as follows:\n\n$$D_{\\rm HS}(\\rho,\\sigma)={\\rm tr}\\left((\\rho-\\sigma)^{2}\\right)\\tag{9}$$\n\nExpanding the equation above results in three distinct terms: tr(\u03c1\u03c3), tr(\u03c3 2 ), and tr(\u03c1 2 ) [47]. The term tr(\u03c1\u03c3) quantifies the distance between two ensembles in Hilbert space through the overlap between clusters; a value of tr(\u03c1\u03c3) = 1 suggests that the ensembles are formed from identical pure states, whereas tr(\u03c1\u03c3) = 0 indicates orthogonality among all embedded data points. User The 'purity' terms tr(\u03c1 2 ) and tr(\u03c3 2 ) assess the overlap within clusters. In the quantum self-attention network, since we are more concerned with the similarity between queries and keys, we omit tr(\u03c3 2 ) and tr(\u03c1 2 ), ultimately using only tr(\u03c1\u03c3) as the method for calculating the similarity between queries and keys in the quantum self-attention network.\n\nFor |xq\u27e9 and |xk\u27e9, they are obtained from the initial state |0\u27e9 \u2297n through the unitary transformation Uemb(x, \u03b8), so |xq\u27e9 and |xk\u27e9 are both pure states. To obtain the mixed states, we extract information from the first n/2-qubit subsystem A of the entire n-qubit quantum system by performing a partial trace operation on the quantum system and discarding the remaining n/2-qubit subsystem B. Specifically, this operation transforms the pure states |xq\u27e9 and |xk\u27e9 of the entire system into the mixed states \u03c1q and \u03c3k of the corresponding subsystems, respectively:\n\n$$\\rho_{q}=\\mbox{tr}_{B}(|x_{q}\\rangle\\langle x_{q}|)\\tag{10}$$\n\n$$\\sigma_{k}=\\mbox{tr}_{B}(|x_{k}\\rangle\\langle x_{k}|)$$\n\nwhere trB(\u00b7) is the partial trace over system B.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_5_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFig. 3.

If we perform a measurement on the auxiliary qubit and obtain the result |0\u27e9, the SWAP test passes, otherwise it fails. Therefore, in this case, the probability of |ei\u27e9 \u2297 |fj \u27e9 passing the SWAP test [54] is\n\n$$p(|0\\rangle)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{|\\langle e_{i}|f_{j}\\rangle|^{2}}{2}\\tag{12}$$\n\nFor |ei\u27e9 \u2297|fj \u27e9 in the probability piqj , the probability of the mixed state \u03c1 \u2297 \u03c3 passing the SWAP test is:\n\n$$p(|0\\rangle)=\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}p_{i}q_{j}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{|\\langle e_{i}|f_{j}\\rangle|^{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n\n$$=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}p_{i}q_{j}\\langle e_{i}|f_{j}\\rangle\\langle f_{j}|e_{i}\\rangle$$\n\n$$=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}p_{i}q_{j}\\text{tr}(|e_{i}\\rangle\\langle e_{i}|f_{j}\\rangle\\langle f_{j}|)$$\n\n$$=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\text{tr}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{i}p_{i}|e_{i}\\rangle\\langle e_{i}|\\right)\\left(\\sum_{j}q_{j}|f_{j}\\rangle\\langle f_{j}|\\right)\\right]$$\n\n$$=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\text{tr}(\\rho\\sigma)\\tag{13}$$\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [38] Guangxi Li, Xuanqiang Zhao, and Xin Wang.

TESTING AND DEBUGGING PHASE MODULATION (PM) BLOCKS*\n\nTesting and debugging AP blocks were relatively straightforward; however, moving on to the PM and AR blocks gets more challenging. This subsection will consider a strategy for debugging a PM block. The most straightforward PM block would be a circuit containing any phase gate, such as a T, Z, CZ, or S gate.\n\nThe challenge in creating test vectors for PM blocks is choosing the correct tests to detect subtle phase shifts. These shifts, often representing the core computational output of the circuit, require high precision in both the generation and measurement phases. The approach typically involves initializing the circuit in a superposition state where the effects of phase modulation can be maximally observed. Cirquo's fQuantTester(circuit, test_vectors) allows users to use their test vectors as state vectors to perform unit testing on PM and AR blocks.\n\nThough the test in Figure 5 can tell us whether an error in the circuit exists, it can not provide further information about that error. However, we can use other approaches to get more information about the possible error.\n\nThe strategy we propose here is to use the swap test [58]. The swap test is a fundamental quantum computing procedure used to determine the similarity between two quantum states. It is beneficial for measuring the inner product of two states, which can then be utilized to calculate their fidelity or similarity.\n\nConsider two quantum states |\u03c8\u27e9 and |\u03d5\u27e9 that we want to compare. The swap test involves an ancillary qubit (the control qubit) initialized in the state |0\u27e9 and the two states |\u03c8\u27e9 and |\u03d5\u27e9. The process of the swap test involves the following steps:\n\n- 1) Apply a Hadamard gate to the control qubit, putting it into the superposition \u221a 1 2 (|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9).\n- 2) Perform a CSWAP gate using the control qubit. The CSWAP gate swaps |\u03c8\u27e9 and |\u03d5\u27e9 only if the control qubit is in the state |1\u27e9.\n- 3) Apply another Hadamard gate to the control qubit.\n- 4) Measure the control qubit. The probability of measuring |0\u27e9 is given by P(0) = 1 2 + 1 2 |\u27e8\u03c8|\u03d5\u27e9|2 .\n\nThe outcome of the measurement gives us information about the similarity of the two states. If the states are identical, the probability of measuring |0\u27e9 in the control qubit will be 1. If they are orthogonal, the probability will be 1 2 .\n\nWe can further analyze the swap test results for more information about the phase difference. To do that, consider |\u03c8\u27e9 = |0\u27e9 + e i\u03b81 |1\u27e9 and |\u03d5\u27e9 = |0\u27e9 + e i\u03b82 |1\u27e9. We can then recalculate the probability of measuring 1 or 0 as a function of \u03b81 and \u03b82 as follows:\n\nThe inner product of these two states is\n\n$$\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+e^{i(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})}\\right).\\tag{6}$$\n\nWe need to find the magnitude squared of this inner product. Since e i(\u03b82\u2212\u03b81) can be expressed as cos(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81) + isin(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81), and \u2206\u03b8 = \u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81 we get\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+e^{i(\\Delta\\theta)}\\right)\\right|^{2}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\left[1+\\cos(\\Delta\\theta)\\right]^{2}+\\left[\\sin(\\Delta\\theta)\\right]^{2}\\right).\\tag{7}$$\n\nThe probability P(0) is given by\n\n$$P(0)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle\\right|^{2}.\\tag{8}$$\n\nSubstituting the magnitude squared into this, we get\n\n$$P(0)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\left[1+\\cos(\\Delta\\theta)\\right]^{2}+\\left[\\sin(\\Delta\\theta)\\right]^{2}\\right)\\tag{9}$$\n\n$$=\\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}\\cos(\\Delta\\theta).\\tag{10}$$\n\nSince P(1) = 1 \u2212 P(0), we substitute our expression for P(0) and simplify\n\n$$P(1)=\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{4}\\cos(\\Delta\\theta).\\tag{11}$$\n\nAfter implementing the swap test in Qiskit (Listing 4), we calculate the squared inner product using the number of shots using the equation s = 1 \u2212 2 N B. s is the squared inner product, N is the total number of shots, and B is the number of times 1 was measured.\n\n```\n1 q = QuantumRegister(3, 'q')\n2 c = ClassicalRegister(1, 'c')\n3 circuit = QuantumCircuit(q, c)\n5 circuit.h(q[0])\n6 circuit.cswap(q[0], q[1], q[2])\n7 circuit.h(q[0])\n9 circuit.measure(q[0], c[0])\n11 simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')\n12 N = 8192\n13 job = execute(circuit, simulator, shots=nShots)\n14 counts = job.result().get_counts()\n16 if '1' in counts:\n17 B = counts['1']\n18 else:\n19 B = 0\n20 s = 1 - (2 / N) * B\n```\n4\n\n8\n\n10\n\n15\n\nListing 4: An Implementation of a simple swap test using Qiskit.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg</img>\nFIGURE 7: Using the swap test to detect the phase difference in a circuit containing a phase error p.

For completeness, we now recall both.\n\nFor our purposes, it is useful to describe the Hadamard Test as an algorithm that accepts a description of a circuit U and construct a new circuit that implements the test.\n\nProposition 1 (Hadamard Test). Given a classical description of the circuit U on q qubit, there exist an algorithm that constructs a circuit HTU on q + 1 qubits (see Figure 1 for the circuit) such that for any q-qubit state |\u03bdi q we have\n\n$${\\rm HT}_{\\cal U}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle_{1}\\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle_{q}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left|0\\right\\rangle_{1}\\left(\\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle_{q}+{\\cal U}\\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle_{q}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left|1\\right\\rangle_{1}\\left(\\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle_{q}-{\\cal U}\\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle_{q}\\right)\\tag{2}$$\n\nThe circuit HTU serves as an implementation of the Hadamard Test. Upon applying the Hadamard Test to |0i 1 |\u03bdi q , the probability of obtaining 0 after measurement of the first qubit is\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\mathbf{Re}\\left(\\langle\\nu|{\\mathcal{U}}\\,|\\nu\\rangle\\right).$$\n\nThe cost of constructing HTU is O(gU ) and the depth is dU + 2. To obtain the imaginary part, the phase gate S = 1 0 0 i can be employed. In this complex version, we simply apply S \u2020 after the initial Hadamard gate, and the probability of obtaining 0 after measurement of the first qubit is\n\n$${\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(1+\\mathbf{Im}\\left(\\langle\\nu|{\\mathcal{U}}\\,|\\nu\\rangle\\right)\\right)$$\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_6_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFigure 1: Circuit Implementing of Hadamard test\n</F>\n\nRemark 2. If we have access to a circuit U\u03bd such that U\u03bd |0iq = |\u03bdiq , and a circuit U\u03b7 such that U\u03b7 |0iq = |\u03b7iq , then one can use Hadamard Test for overlap estimation (with relative phase information as well) by the following identity: h\u03bd|\u03b7i = h0| U\u2217 \u03bd U\u03b7 |0i, e.g. in that case we have that\n\n$$p(0)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\mathbf{Re}\\left(\\left\\langle0|\\mathcal{U}_{\\nu}^{\\star}\\mathcal{U}_{\\eta}\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\right\\right\\rangle\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\mathbf{Re}\\left(\\left\\langle\\nu|\\eta\\right\\rangle\\right)\\right)\\tag{3}$$\n\nfor the output of HTU \u2217 \u03bd U\u03b7 , where p(0) denotes the probability of measuring 0 in the first qubit (when only that qubit is measured).\n\nProposition 3 (Swap Test). For q qubits, there exist an a circuit STq on 2q + 1 qubits (see Figure 2 for the circuit) such that for any two q-qubit states |\u03c8i q and |\u03c6i q we have\n\n$$\\mathrm{ST}_{q}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle_{1}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle_{q}\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle_{q}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left|0\\right\\rangle_{1}\\left(\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle_{q}\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle_{q}+\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle_{q}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle_{q}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left|1\\right\\rangle_{1}\\left(\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle_{q}\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle_{q}-\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle_{q}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle_{q}\\right)$$\n\nThe circuit STq serves as an implementation of the Swap Test. Upon applying the Swap Test to |0i 1 |\u03c8i q |\u03c6i q , the probability of obtaining 0 after measurement of the first qubit is\n\n$${\\frac{1}{2}}(1+|\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^{2}).$$\n\nThe cost of constructing STq is q + 2 and the depth is 3.\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{|0\\rangle_{1}\\ \\raisebox{-0.86pt}{\\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{./.eps}}}}\\\\ {{\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle_{q}\\ \\raisebox{-0.86pt}{\\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{./.eps}}}}\\end{array}$$\n\nFigure 2: Circuit Implementing of Swap Test\nSource 4:\n# Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Classification in Credit Sales Risk\n\nwhere p a \u03b1i is the probability of obtaining state |ii after a measurement (what is given by the probability amplitude \u03b1i).\n\nSuch form of the cost function f is determined by the way in which the information concerning probability distribution may be gained from the quantum device, e.g. IBM Q Experience, where repeating the experiment allows obtaining the probability distribution. This approach seems to be more realistic in a context of current capabilities of available quantum devices. Therefore, in the description of our experiment, we assume that the cost function f depicts an error as the absolute difference between two probability distributions.\n\nIt should be mentioned that quantum computing makes possible comparing two quantum states (e.g. p a and p t ) by so-called SWAP-test [3]. It is possible because the SWAP-test is based on the scalar product of examined states (in this aspect it is similar to the Fidelity measure). A general scheme of the SWAP-test is also shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThis simple circuit allows measuring a state of the first output qubit. The resemblance of states |\u03c8i and |\u03c6i is reflected as the probability of obtaining state |0i on the first qubit is P0 = 1 2 + 1 2 |h\u03c8|\u03c6i|2 . If P0 = 1 then analyzed states are the same, because it means that inner product h\u03c8|\u03c6i = 1. The more states point out the opposite points on the Bloch sphere, the less similar they are. For the orthogonal states, the product h\u03c8|\u03c6i = 0 and then P0 = 0.5. The SWAPtest is useful for checking the similarity of two quantum states. In addition, the SWAP-test may be applied for each qubit utilized in the VQA method. An evaluation of the classification may be also realized as examining the probability distribution after the completed test. The observation is correctly classified if for each of three qubits the high probability of obtaining |0i is gained. The class is represented by the set of circuit's parameters \u03b8i in the VQE method.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [3] Barenco, A., Berthiaume, A., Deutsch, D., Ekert, A., Jozsa, R., Macchiavello, Ch.: Stabilization of Quantum Computations by Symmetrization.

Experimental Validation of the Generalized TQME Protocol on IBM's Superconducting System\n\nTo validate the generalized TQME protocol, we conducted experiments on IBM's superconducting system (ibmq quito). As illustrated in Fig. S3a, we employed a quantum circuit consisting of four qubits to evaluate the similarity between single-qubit gates. The main objective was to assess the similarity between the single-qubit gate under evaluation *UV* and the standard singlequbit gate *UW* . By adjusting the angles of the RX and RY gates, various implementations of *UW* and *UV* were realized. In the experiment, 21 sets of single-qubit unitary transformations *UW* and *UV* were randomly selected, with fidelities spanning from 0 to 1. We utilized the generalized TQME protocol to evaluate the fidelity of *UV* with respect to *UW* . To correct for readout errors, the final measurement results were processed using the unfolding method for error mitigation [2]. The experimental results, presented in Fig. S3b, indicate that the measured fidelities align closely with the theoretical predictions.\n\n<sup>[1]</sup> J. C. Garcia-Escartin and P.

The compact version of HTC is by [114]. While the full quantum space in Eq. (1) seems to be powerful, it is pointed in [82] that it can fail to learn a simple function. To overcome this, the *projected quantum kernel*, that projects the quantum kernel into classical one and compute the elements of kernels from the functions of reduced density matrices is introduced in [82] to obtain better quantum kernels that can also learn the data derived from the discrete-log problems in [119].\n\n### 5.2.2 Swap-test Classifier\n\nThe Swap-test classifier as proposed in [81] is implemented as a distance-based quantum classifier where the kernel is based on the quantum state fidelity raised to a certain power at the cost of using multiple copies of training and test data. The choice of the quantum feature map plays a pivotal role in defining the kernel and the overall efficiency of the classifier. The training and test data are encoded in a specific format following which the classifier is realized by means of the swap-test [30].\n\nThe swap test measures the similarity between the input quantum state and the reference quantum states for each class using measurements to compute a similarity score that indicates the overlap between the input state and the reference states.\n\n#### 5.2.3 Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)\n\nThese algorithms primarily focus on optimizing the parameters of the PQC and known to provide a general framework that is compatible with different classes of problems leading to different structures and grades of complexity. The optimization is performed classically while allowing the circuit to remain shallow making it a versatile tool for near term quantum devices.\n\nThis basic structure of VQC involves the following three steps :\n\n- Quantum Feature Map : A non-linear feature map \u03d5 is employed to encode the classical data x to the quantum state space. This is done by applying the circuit U\u03d5(x) to the initial state |0\u27e9 \u2297n :\n\n$$|\\Phi(x)\\rangle=U_{\\phi(x)}|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}.$$\n\nThe initial state |0\u27e9 \u2297n can be replaced by any fiducial quantum state as shown in [128].

C-SWAP test methodology for *C*\u03b1 atom distance estimation\n\nFirst introduced in the context of quantum fingerprinting [126]. The procedure for engineering the SWAP test circuit involves, (i) Entangling qubit registers consisting of the mapped classical data with an ancillary/helper qubit |0\u27e9 and, (ii) estimating the inner product between two different states through repeated measurements of the ancillary qubit. Thus, this quantum algorithm measures the so-called *fidelity*, which is nothing but the inner product or overlap between two different quantum states. The fidelity *F* between two normalized quantum states |\u03d5\u27e9, |\u03c8\u27e9 is mathematically expressed as, *F*(\u03d5, \u03c8) = |\u27e8\u03d5|\u03c8\u27e9| 2 \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nHence, the higher the fidelity, the closer are the quantum states to each other, i.e, *F*(\u03d5, \u03c8) = 1, meaning the quantum states are parallel while *F*(\u03d5, \u03c8) = 0 meaning orthogonal quantum states.\n\nFrom an application point of view, this quantum routine has been integrated into larger quantum circuits to achieve the target tasks. For example, it has been used as a primary engine for speeding-up matrix multiplications boiling down to merely O(*N* 2 ) [59] time-complexity. Moreover it has been extensively used in the domains of *quantum machine learning* and *big-data* analysis (also sometimes called *quantum big data*) due to its exponential speedup offered in calculating distances between huge amounts of vector (tensor) datasets [74, 85, 127].\n\n*Circuit Description.* We initialize an ancillary (helper) qubit |0\u27e9, two quantum registers |\u03c8\u27e9 and |\u03d5\u27e9. The initial state of combined tensor product is\n\n$\\Psi_{A}\\rangle=|0\\rangle\\otimes|\\phi\\rangle\\otimes|\\psi\\rangle$, (B.1)\n\nEncoded into the states |\u03d5\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u27e9 are classical data atom coordinates using the AMPLITUDE encoding method. In *amplitude encoding*, a classical vector or tensor, *X* = - *x*1, *x*2, ..., *xn T* \u2208 R *N* is mapped onto the quantum device by implementing the following algorithm written as a pseudocode:\n\nAlgorithm 1 Amplitude Encoding Schema\n\nInput: Classical data, *X* = - *x*0, *x*1, ..., *xp*\u22121 *T* \u2208 R *p* , number of qubits *n*.\n\nResult: Quantum data with coefficients of *X* \u2208 R *p* encoded as amplitudes of the state-vector *X* 7\u2192 |*QX*\u27e9 = 1 ||x||2 P*n*\u22121 *i*=0 *xi* |*i*\u27e9\n\n1: *p* \u2190 LEN(*X*) 2: if \u2308*log*2(*n*)\u2309 \u2212 *p* = 0 then 3: *QX* \u2190 *X* {Calculate magnitude (norm) squared of *X*} 4: *QX* 7\u2192 |*QX*\u27e9 = 1 ||*X*||2 P*n*\u22121 *i*=0 *xi* |*i*\u27e9 5: end if 6: if \u2308*log*2(*n*)\u2309 \u2212 *p* = (*k* \u2212 1) then 7: *QX* \u2190 - *x*0, *x*1, ..., *xp*\u22121 p-entries , 0, ....., 0 (k-1) -entries *T* | {z } *p* + (*k* \u2212 1) = *n* {Pad the vector *X* with (*k* \u2212 1) 0's to convert to dimension *n*.} 8: *QX* 7\u2192 |*QX*\u27e9 = 1 ||*X*||2 P*p*\u22121 *i*=0 *xi* |*i*\u27e9 + P*n*\u22121 *i*=*p* 0 |*i*\u27e9 {Calculate magnitude (norm) squared of *X*} 9: end if 10: return |*QX*\u27e9\n\nThus, an *n*-dimensional classical data vector (tensor) can be efficiently encoded into the wavefunction (state vector), requiring merely \u2308log2(n)\u2309 qubits [106]. Here, we describe the methodology to adapt the SWAP test quantum circuit [126, 106, 127] for *C*\u03b1 atoms distance matrix calculations.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] E. Deelman, K.

The swap and inversion tests represent the predominant approaches among the various available methods. The inversion test, shown in detail in Fig. 2b, measures the overlap between the pure quantum states of two data points *x* and *x* \u2032 by applying the unitary feature map of *x* followed by the adjoint of the unitary feature map of *x* \u2032 . This method doesn't require additional qubits, but results in circuits twice as deep as those used in the swap test and only works with unitary feature maps. The computation of the kernel matrix with this method requires *O*(*n* 2 ) kernel evaluations, where *n* is the size of the data. In contrast, the swap test, depicted in Fig. 2c embeds the quantum states for two data points, *x* and *x* \u2032 , in parallel, using a controlled swap gate to extract similarity information into an additional qubit, which is then measured in the computation base. While this works for pure and mixed states, it requires twice the circuit width of the inversion test, requiring devices with many qubits. It relies on the swap trick, which derives the inner product from the tensor product of density matrices \u03c1*i* and \u03c1*j* utilizing a swap gate S, expressed in Eq. 7:\n\n$${\\rm Tr}(\\rho_{i}\\rho_{j})={\\rm Tr}(\\delta\\rho_{i}\\otimes\\rho_{j}).\\tag{7}$$\n\n# 3 Related Work\n\n### 3.1 Quantum Anomaly Detection\n\nThis work tackles the time complexity issue raised by Kyriienko *et al.* [11], which combines the one-class SVM with a complex computational kernel based on the IQP-like feature map (Fig. 2a) to achieve a 20% improvement in average precision compared to the traditional benchmark. It expands on our prior work [12], which explores two strategies to reduce time complexity in relation to data size: Variable Subsampling ensembles with Inversion Test kernels and single models using the Randomized Measurements kernel.\n\nHybrid quantum-classical models have emerged as a leading approach in anomaly detection. For example, Sakhnenko *et al.* [15] has refined the hidden representation of an auto-encoder (AE) by integrating a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) with its bottleneck. This approach transitions to an unsupervised model after training, replacing the decoder with an isolation forest, and assessing the performance across various datasets and PQC architectures. In parallel, Herr *et al.* [9] has adapted the classical AnoGAN [16] by incorporating a Wasserstein GAN, in which the generator is substituted with a hybrid quantum-classical neural network. The network is subsequently trained using a variational algorithm.\n\nIn contrast, methods like the QUBO-SVM mentioned in Wang *et al.* [19] transform the standard SVM optimization problem into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. This enables efficient solving using quantum annealing solvers, preserving the traditional SVM optimization framework while accelerating accurate prediction by effectively identifying kernel functions, thus allowing for practical real-time anomaly detection.\n\nRay *et al.* [13] explores hybrid ensembles that integrate bagging and stacking techniques using a combination of quantum and classical components, each playing a significant role in anomaly detection. The quantum components encompass various variable quantum circuit architectures, kernel-based SVMs, and quantum annealing-based SVMs. In contrast, the classical components consist of logistic regression, graph convolutional neural networks, and light gradient boosting models.\n\n### 3.2 Efficient Gram Matrix Evaluation\n\nQuantum kernel methods play a crucial role in various quantum machine learning applications, but they face significant computational challenges. To address these difficulties, two approaches have been proposed: (i) *Quantum-Friendly Classical Methods*, which reduce the number of kernel matrix elements that need to be evaluated, and (ii) *Quantum Native Methods*, which aim to minimize the overall number of measurements required and rely on classical post-processing, which is easily parallelizable or vectorizable.\n\nRandomized Measurement kernels, pioneered by Haug *et al.* in 2021 [7] and combined with hardware-efficient feature maps. They enable faster kernel measurement, but could only approximate Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels on both synthetic and MNIST data. In contrast, the classical shadow method, proposed by Huang *et al.* in 2020 [10], employs a similar quantum protocol but diverges in classical post-processing. It provides classical state snapshots through the inversion of a quantum channel, often achieving reduced error in predicting the second R\u00e9nyi Entropy.\n\nVariable subsampling, which was first introduced by Aggarwal and Sathe in 2015 [2], and its advanced counterpart, variable subsampling with rotated bagging, present an efficient approach to ensemble training. The methods use different sample sizes and rotational orthogonal axis system projections to improve both computational efficiency and an adaptive ensemble model training strategy. They have been successfully tested with algorithms like the local outlier factor (LOF) models and the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.\n\nThe Distance-based Importance Sampling and Clustering (DISC) approach, proposed by Hajibabaee *et al.* [6], and Block Basis Factorization (BBF), introduced by Wang *et al.* [20], are both variations of matrix decomposition-based methods for kernel approximation. DISC constructs approximation matrices using cluster centroids as landmarks and assumes the kernel matrix to be symmetrical. On the other hand, BBF creates a smaller inner similarity matrix by employing randomized spectral value decomposition on cluster samples, delivering superior performance in comparison to the k-means Nystr\u00f6m method.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [2] Aggarwal, C.C., Sathe, S.: Theoretical foundations and algorithms for outlier ensembles.

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand how to implement a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQFE) for finding the ground state energy of a complex molecule. Hmm, where do I even start? I know that VQE is a quantum algorithm that approximates the ground state energy of a system, which is super useful because molecules are too big for classical computers to handle directly.\n\nFirst, I think I need to have some quantum hardware available. But wait, quantum computers aren't just for chemistry; they're really versatile. There are companies like IBM Quantum and Google Cloud that offer cloud-based qubits. Oh right, but if the molecule is really large or complicated, running it on a local quantum computer might be challenging. So maybe using a service where they have access to multiple qubits simultaneously? That would make sense because you could run variational states across many qubits in parallel.\n\nBut how do I choose which quantum state to use for my trial wavefunction? I remember that the VQE uses a parameterized state, like a circuit, and then optimizes its parameters. The most common approach is to mix this with an initial guess. A coherent mixer might be good here because it introduces some controlled phase shifts across all qubits, helping the optimization converge faster.\n\nNow, setting up the Hamiltonian for my system seems crucial. I need to make sure it correctly represents the energy of the molecule I'm studying. That means defining all the interactions between the atoms in the molecule, like spin-spin couplings and external fields if any. The exact form might require some research on molecular structure.\n\nOnce the Hamiltonian is ready, how do I set up the initial state? Maybe a simple product state where each qubit is in its own state, or perhaps something more entangled. A tensor network that's easy to parameterize would be best for optimization. I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here, maybe I need to look into some existing code examples or tutorials on implementing VQE.\n\nOptimizing with classical computing tools like Qiskit and PyTorch makes sense. Quantum computers can't do this for me, so it's all on my side. I'd have to implement a cost function that evaluates the expectation value of the Hamiltonian based on the parameters of my trial state. Then, using gradient descent or other optimization algorithms from libraries like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn would help find the best parameter values.\n\nWait, what about the number of qubits required for such a molecule? If it's large, I might need more qubits to represent the system accurately. I should check if IBM's or Google's quantum processing units can handle that many qubits in parallel. Also, noise levels could be an issue; I'll need to make sure my circuit is fault-tolerant or account for errors during optimization.\n\nI'm a bit fuzzy on some of these details. For example, how exactly does the VQE framework work? Is it just taking the state from the quantum computer and using it in the classical optimizer, or do they implement specific steps like parameter estimation and gradient calculation manually? I think the framework takes care of that, but maybe for someone without much experience, setting up the cost function is a bit tricky.\n\nAnother thing to consider is how long the algorithm would take. Even with local hardware, if the molecule has thousands of qubits or requires many parameter updates, it might not finish in reasonable time. So I need to optimize my parameter choices and maybe use more powerful quantum hardware for bigger molecules.\n\nAlso, I should remember that VQE gives an energy estimate, but there's always a ground state energy uncertainty because the algorithm is probabilistic. To get better estimates, I might run multiple instances of the algorithm or improve the circuit parameters over time with more optimization steps.\n\nI'm trying to visualize how this would work step by step: setting up the problem on the quantum computer, then sending it to my local machine where I can set up and optimize the cost function. Each iteration of classical optimization adjusts the parameters, which is then fed back into the quantum processor to get a new state for evaluation.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure about how the initial guess in the VQE affects performance. Maybe using a more informed initial state that accounts for some known parts of the molecule's structure could lead to faster convergence. That might require some trial and error or prior knowledge of the system's ground state energy.\n\nAlso, I wonder if there are any tricks to reduce computational complexity. Perhaps using certain basis states or symmetry considerations in the Hamiltonian? But for a general case with complex molecules, that might not be feasible without more specific structures.\n\nAnother consideration is the type of molecule I'm working with. If it's an organic compound, perhaps I can model each atom as a qubit and build up the Hamiltonian from there. For example, each carbon could be a spin-1/2 system, connected to neighboring spins through coupling terms. That might complicate the Hamiltonian but make it manageable.\n\nI also need to think about how to handle multiple qubits in parallel during optimization. If I have multiple qubits running the same circuit at once, can I combine their results? Probably not directly; each should be evaluated separately and then averaged or summed up as part of the cost function.\n\nLastly, I should look into any existing code examples or tutorials that guide someone through implementing VQE for specific molecules. Maybe starting with simple molecules like H2 or CO and then scaling up to more complex systems would help build confidence before tackling larger molecules.\n</think>\n\nTo implement a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQFE) for finding the ground state energy of a complex molecule, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Quantum Hardware Access**: Utilize cloud-based quantum computing services like IBM Quantum or Google Cloud to access multiple qubits simultaneously, enabling parallel processing.\n\n2. **Wavefunction Parameterization**: Choose an initial parameterized trial wavefunction, such as a product state or a tensor network, which can be adjusted during optimization.\n\n3. **Hamiltonian Setup**: Define the Hamiltonian accurately using all interactions between atoms (spin-spin couplings and external fields) for your molecule. Ensure the correct representation of molecular structure.\n\n4. **Initial State Selection**: Use an initial state, such as a simple product state or tensor network, that is easy to parameterize. A coherent mixer might help by introducing controlled phase shifts across qubits.\n\n5. **Cost Function Implementation**: Implement the VQE framework on your quantum computer, using a cost function based on the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to the trial state parameters.\n\n6. **Classical Optimization**: Utilize libraries like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn for classical optimization (e.g., gradient descent) to adjust parameters that minimize the cost function.\n\n7. **Parameter Choices and Complexity Handling**: Consider the number of qubits required for your molecule, ensuring hardware can handle it. Optimize parameter choices for efficiency and consider quantum noise mitigation.\n\n8. **Algorithm Execution and Results**: Run the algorithm on the quantum computer, then send results to a classical processor. Repeat optimization with updated parameters until convergence is achieved or computational limits are reached.\n\n9. **Performance Adjustments**: Optimize circuit design for parallel execution if possible. Consider symmetry or basis state handling for specific molecules and balance between multiple qubit evaluations.\n\n10. **Uncertainty Mitigation**: Improve estimates by running multiple instances or employing more advanced optimization techniques, acknowledging uncertainty in the energy estimate.\n\nBy following these steps, you can implement a VQFE effectively for complex molecular systems, leveraging quantum hardware and classical optimization to approximate ground state energies."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this text about hybrid quantum-classical approaches in material discovery for predicting maximum absorbance (\u03bbmax) of DAE derivatives. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that they developed a cVQD method using a computational-basis Variational Quantum Deflation approach. From what I remember, VQD is a technique used in quantum computing to find multiple eigenstates of a Hamiltonian, which are important for various applications like material discovery and chemistry simulations. The 'c' stands for computational basis, meaning it's based on the qubits you have available, not the classical data.\n\nIn this case, they're using cVQD to construct an Ising Hamiltonian that predicts \u03bbmax accurately. They trained it with 384 DAE derivatives and tested it on 4096 more. That\u2019s a pretty large dataset! So, by training on a subset of the data, maybe they\u2019re getting a good enough model to predict \u03bbmax for new DAE candidates.\n\nThey mention that using cVQD on a quantum simulator gave results close to exact eigensolver calculations. That\u2019s reassuring because it shows that even with limited data, the method can still perform well if more qubits are added. But since they\u2019re working within their dataset of 4096 derivatives, maybe they can focus on optimizing those specific candidates.\n\nThe text also talks about error suppression and mitigation techniques. I think this means they're taking into account any potential errors or noise in the quantum calculations when running simulations. If there's a chance of inaccuracies due to limited qubit numbers, these methods help reduce that impact by compensating for the errors without completely discarding the data.\n\nI'm trying to connect how all this ties back to the overall goal of material discovery. Material discovery aims to find molecules with desirable properties using computational methods. In this case, \u03bbmax is a key property because it relates to optical activity and can influence applications like solar cells or pharmaceuticals.\n\nBut there are challenges here. First, the training data set isn\u2019t comprehensive. They\u2019re only using 384 derivatives from QM9, which I know has some limitations. Maybe other functional groups aren't well-represented, leading to poor generalization in predictions. Also, using a small quantum simulator might not allow for enough flexibility when adding more qubits as needed.\n\nAnother point is the computational cost. While cVQD is efficient for finding eigenstates, each run requires multiple shots on the quantum processor. If they have 12 qubits available and need to perform many calculations, this could be time-consuming. They might need optimization in how these runs are scheduled or parallelized.\n\nI'm also thinking about scalability. The text mentions that if more data is added, say another set of DAE derivatives, the model's performance would improve without needing a huge quantum device. But as they're currently working within their 4096 candidate set, maybe they can focus on optimizing each derivative individually with less resource investment.\n\nIn summary, cVQD seems like a promising method because it efficiently finds multiple eigenstates from limited data and has good error suppression capabilities. The use of a quantum simulator allows for testing these methods without additional qubits, making the approach both feasible and scalable within their current resources.\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses a hybrid quantum-classical approach using cVQD (computational-basis Variational Quantum Deflation) to predict \u03bbmax in DAE derivatives. Here's an organized summary of key points:\n\n1. **Methodology**: \n   - Utilizes cVQD to construct an Ising Hamiltonian based on a dataset of 384 DAE derivatives from QM9.\n   - Predicts \u03bbmax for a larger set of 4096 derivatives, suggesting the method can be optimized further.\n\n2. **Training and Performance**:\n   - Closely models results from exact eigensolvers on quantum simulators, indicating accuracy even with limited data.\n   - Error suppression techniques mitigate potential inaccuracies in small quantum systems.\n\n3. **Challenges and Considerations**:\n   - Training dataset is not comprehensive, potentially missing important functional groups in QM9.\n   - The method uses a fixed number of qubits (12), limiting scalability potential as more qubits become available.\n   - The computational cost includes multiple quantum shots per calculation, which may be prohibitive for large datasets.\n\n4. **Scalability and Optimizations**:\n   - Scalable within the current 12-qubit setup, allowing efficient testing of derivative-specific optimizations without additional hardware.\n   - Focused on optimizing each derivative individually, minimizing resource investment while enhancing accuracy.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - cVQD is a promising approach for material discovery due to its efficiency and error handling, but further improvements are needed with a more comprehensive training dataset to ensure robust performance across diverse functional groups.\n\nThis approach demonstrates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in computational chemistry, particularly for tasks like material discovery, while highlighting areas for improvement.",

Nowadays, VQE has attracted much attention in quantum computing due to their relatively low circuit depth and robustness against noise [27, 28] which has led to successful studies for the simulation of small molecules on available quantum hardwares and simulators by reducing the number of qubits [29\u201333]. However, more facilities, simulators and hardware are needed to extend this approach to larger systems [34].\n\nVQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to estimate the minimum eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian by exploiting the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle [26, 35]. In VQE, the ground state trial wave function of a molecule, called ansatz, is built up with adjustable parameters and a quantum circuit is designed to realize this ansatz. Then, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is measured on a quantum computer. Finally, the parameters of the ansatz are optimized iteratively on a classical computer. VQE uses both quantum and classical computers, so it requires fewer quantum hardware facilities compared to pure quantum algorithms, such as the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm [36].\n\nHere, we implement VQE to calculate the ground state energy of molecules such as Trihydrogen Cation (H+ 3 ), which is one of the most abundant ions in the universe and is the simplest triatomic molecule, Hydroxide ion (OH\u2212) which acts as a base, a ligand and a catalyst, Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) which uses to make most fluorinecontaining compounds such as pharmaceutical medications and Trihydridoboron, also known as Borane (BH3) which is a very strong Lewis acid. In these molecules, the number of qubits has an increasing trend. Moreover, we use computational chemistry approaches such as UHF and FCI to find the ground state energy. Consequently, the results of the ground state energy obtained from VQE are compared to FCI methods, as benchmark energy. It is important to note, we have implemented the Python-based software package on local clusters for our VQE simulation.\n\nIn the remainder of the paper, we first review the VQE framework for molecular electronic structure calculations including the derivation of the second-quantized Hamiltonian, fermion to qubit transformation, construction of ansatz and general steps of VQE. Then, the ground state energies of H+ 3 , OH\u2212, HF and BH3 molecules are calculated based on VQE, UHF and FCI. Finally, the results are discussed in the conclusion section.\n\n# **II. VARIATIONAL QUANTUM EIGENSOLVER FORMALISM**\n\n#### **A. Second-quantized Hamiltonian**\n\nWe start with the definition of Hamiltonian of a molecule consisting of *M* nuclei and *N* electrons in atomic units (\u210f = 1) as\n\n$$H=-\\sum_{i}\\frac{\\nabla_{\\bf R_{i}}^{2}}{2M_{i}}-\\sum_{i}\\frac{\\nabla_{\\bf r_{i}}^{2}}{2}-\\sum_{i,j}\\frac{Z_{i}}{|{\\bf R_{i}}-{\\bf r_{j}}|}$$\n\n$$+\\sum_{i,j>i}\\frac{Z_{i}Z_{j}}{|{\\bf R_{i}}-{\\bf R_{j}}|}+\\sum_{i,j>i}\\frac{1}{|{\\bf r_{i}}-{\\bf r_{j}}|}\\tag{1}$$\n\nwhere **Ri** , *Mi* and *Zi* are the position, mass and charge of the nuclei, respectively, and **ri** denotes the position of the electrons. This form of the Hamiltonian is often said the first-quantized representation of molecular Hamiltonian. It generally imposes the fermionic nature of the electron through an antisymmetric wave function [32, 37]. Some methods were developed to tackle this Hamiltonian in electronic structure problems on quantum computer [38\u201340]. Here, we analyze this problem in the second-quantized form of Hamiltonian.\n\nFor the Hamiltonian representation in the secondquantized formulation, we first use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation which neglects the nuclei motion. So, the nuclei considered to be the fixed classical point charges [41]. Moreover, to convert the Hamiltonian into a computational problem, we select basis functions *\u03d5i* as electronic wave function. Molecular orbitals (MOs) can be constructed as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The atomic orbital basis functions are derived from hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. They are numerically optimized to match desired physical properties of various systems. Basis functions with different forms are used in computational chemistry. The most simple basis functions for computational works are the Slater Type Orbital-*n* Gaussians, STO-*n*G basis sets. These functions are expressed as the sum of Gaussian functions and the original Slater-type orbitals to increase the efficiency of the calculations [32, 37].\n\nThe electronic Hamiltonian in the second-quantized form can be written as [20]\n\n$$H=\\sum_{p q}h_{p q}a_{p}^{\\dagger}a_{q}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{p q r s}h_{p q r s}a_{p}^{\\dagger}a_{q}^{\\dagger}a_{r}a_{s}\\qquad(2)$$\n\nwhere *a* \u2020 *p* and *ap* are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators associated with *p*-th fermionic mode or spin-orbital. The electron is excited into single electron orbital *p* by *a* \u2020 *p* and de-excited by *ap*. Regarding the electron's spatial and spin coordinates **xi** \u2261 (**ri** *,* **si**), the scalar coefficients in Eq.(2) can be calculated by\n\n$$h_{p q}=\\int\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbf{x}\\phi_{p}^{*}(\\mathbf{x})\\Big({\\frac{\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r_{i}}}^{2}}{2}}-\\sum_{i}{\\frac{Z_{i}}{|\\mathbf{R_{i}}-\\mathbf{r_{i}}|}}\\Big)\\phi_{q}^{*}(\\mathbf{x})\\qquad(3)$$\n\n$$h_{pqrs}=\\int\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbf{x}_{2}{\\frac{\\phi_{p}^{*}(\\mathbf{x}_{1})\\phi_{q}^{*}(\\mathbf{x}_{2})\\phi_{r}(\\mathbf{x}_{1})\\phi_{s}(\\mathbf{x}_{2})}{|\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_{2}|}}\\qquad(4)$$\n\nwhere are the one-electron and two-electron integrals, respectively.\n\nIn the first-quantized formulation, the number of electrons is conserved by the operators. So, in the secondquantized one, the operators must have an equal number of creation and annihilation operators. Moreover, in the second-quantized formulation, the anti-symmetry properties of the wave function are applied through the anti-commutation relations of the fermionic creation and annihilations operators as follows [20]\n\n$$\\{a_{p},a_{q}^{\\dagger}\\}=a_{p}a_{q}^{\\dagger}+a_{q}^{\\dagger}a_{p}=\\delta_{p q}\\qquad\\qquad(5)$$\n\n$$\\{a_{p},a_{q}\\}=\\{a_{p}^{\\dagger},a_{q}^{\\dagger}\\}=0\\tag{6}$$\n\nFurthermore, in the first-quantized formulation, the wave function is stored directly, without utilizing any previous information about the molecule. On the contrary, in the second-quantized formulation of Hamiltonian, our information about the molecule such as the occupation of electrons in energy levels and the spatial orbitals would be used. This knowledge leads to a reduction in the qubits needed to simulate molecules. Due to the small number of qubits available in current quantum computers, most quantum computing studies in chemistry to date have used the second-quantized formulation [37].\nSource 2:\nInquantum computing, thevariational quantum eigensolver(VQE) is aquantum algorithmforquantum chemistry,quantum simulationsandoptimization problems. It is a hybrid algorithm that uses both classical computers and quantum computers to find theground stateof a given physical system. Given a guess oransatz, the quantum processor calculates the expectation value of the system with respect to anobservable, often the Hamiltonian, and a classicaloptimizeris used to improve the guess. The algorithm is based on thevariational methodof quantum mechanics.\nIt was originally proposed in 2014, with corresponding authors Alberto Peruzzo,Al\u00e1n Aspuru-GuzikandJeremy O'Brien.[a][1][2]The algorithm has also found applications inquantum machine learningand has been further substantiated by general hybrid algorithms between quantum and classical computers.[3]It is an example of anoisy intermediate-scale quantum(NISQ) algorithm.\nThe objective of the VQE is to find a set of quantum operations that prepares the lowest energy state (or minima) of a close approximation to some target quantity or observable. While the only strict requirement for the representation of an observable is its efficiency in estimating its expectation values, it is often more straightforward if the operator has a compact or simple expression in terms of Pauli operators or tensor products of Pauli operators.\nFor a fermionic system, it is often most convenient to qubitize: that is to write the many-bodyHamiltonianof the system usingsecond quantization, and then use a mapping to write thecreation-annihiliation operatorsin terms of Pauli operators. Common schemes for fermions includeJordan\u2013Wigner transformation,Bravyi\u2013Kitaev transformation, and parity transformation.[4][5]\nOnce the HamiltonianH^{\\displaystyle {\\hat {H}}}is written in terms of Pauli operators and irrelevant states are discarded (finite-dimensional space), it would consist of a linear combination of Pauli stringsP^i{\\displaystyle {\\hat {P}}_{i}}consisting of tensor products ofPauli operators(for exampleX\u2297I\u2297Z\u2297X{\\displaystyle X\\otimes I\\otimes Z\\otimes X}), such that\nwhere\u03b1i{\\displaystyle \\alpha _{i}}are numerical coefficients. Based on the coefficients, the number of Pauli strings can be reduced in order to optimize the calculation.[6]\nThe VQE can be adapted to other optimization problems by adapting the Hamiltonian to be a cost function.[7]\nThe choice of ansatz state depends on the system of interest. Ingate-based quantum computing, the ansatz is given by a parametrizedquantum circuit, whose parameters can be updated after each run. The ansatz has to be adaptable enough to not miss the desired state. A common method to obtain a valid ansatz is given by the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) framework and its extensions.[8]\nIn case of gradient descent, its required to minimize a cost functionf(\u03b8\u2192){\\displaystyle f({\\vec {\\theta }})}where for the VQE casef(\u03b8\u2192)=\u27e8\u03c8(\u03b8\u2192)|H|\u03c8(\u03b8\u2192)\u27e9{\\displaystyle f({\\vec {\\theta }})=\\langle \\psi ({\\vec {\\theta }})|H|\\psi ({\\vec {\\theta }})\\rangle }.

INTRODUCTION\n\nVQE is a hybrid algorithm that combines quantum and classical computing to find the ground state of a system, a key task in quantum chemistry. It uses a parameterized quantum circuit to prepare a quantum state, and a classical optimizer to adjust the circuit parameters. The expectation value of the system's Hamiltonian represents the total energy. This method has been successfully applied to find the ground state energy of various molecules, leveraging the strengths of both quantum and classical computing to tackle this complex problem. VQE's are especially promising for implementation on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and can be tailored to reduce circuit depth and used qubits.\n\nThe VQE's application to *BeH*2 is challenging due to the molecule's complexity and the size of quantum system required as the molecule is relatively large compared to extensively studied molecules like *H*2 and *LiH* [1]. The transformation of the molecule's Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian, which involves simulating the electronic orbital interactions, is complex. Additionally, the increasing circuit depth for larger molecules like *BeH*2 presents a significant challenge. However knowing the ground state energy of a molecule has a range of applications including helping to predict its reactivity, chemical stability, and spectroscopic properties. With this motivation in mind, we perform resource efficient executions of VQE. We use adaptive and tetris-adaptive VQE to reduce the number of two qubit gates and circuit depth. Sec. II describes the mapping of the VQE problem onto a quantum computer and the error mitigation strategies and techniques we implement. Sec. III presents the results from adaptive and tetris-adaptive VQE and from running our VQE algorithm on IBM hardware with TREX and ZNE. Sec.

Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits. The VQE may be used to model complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods.This review aims to provide an overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail including representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process, the post-processing mitigation of errors, and best practices are suggested. We identify four main areas of future research:(1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers;(3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?Learn more about arXivLabs.\narXiv Operational StatusGet status notifications viaemailorslack\nSource 5:\n# Folded Spectrum VQE : A quantum computing method for the calculation of molecular excited states\n\nLila Cadi Tazi1, 2 and Alex J.W.

Theoretically exact quantum algorithms for chemistry have been proposed (e.g. Quantum Phase Estimation), but the limited capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices (NISQ) motivated the development of less demanding hybrid algorithms. In this context, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm was successfully introduced as an effective method to compute the ground-state energy of small molecules. This study investigates the Folded Spectrum (FS) method as an extension to the VQE algorithm for the computation of molecular excited states. It provides the possibility of directly computing excited states around a selected target energy using the same ansatz as for the ground-state calculation. Inspired by the variance-based methods from the Quantum Monte Carlo literature, the FS method minimizes the energy variance, thus, in principle, requiring a computationally expensive squared Hamiltonian to be applied. We alleviate this potentially poor scaling by employing a Pauli grouping procedure, identifying sets of commuting Pauli strings that can be evaluated simultaneously. This allows for a significant reduction in computational cost. We applied the FS-VQE method to small molecules (H2, LiH), obtaining all electronic excited states with chemical accuracy on ideal quantum simulators. Furthermore, we explore the application of quantum error mitigation techniques, demonstrating improved energy accuracy on noisy simulators compared to simulations without mitigation.\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nComputing the electronic structure of molecules and materials is crucial for the prediction of chemical or structural properties. Theoretical chemists and physicists have acknowledged the essential challenges that must be addressed, but the exponentially scaling dimensionality of electronic structure problems seems to be insurmountable on classical computing resources. As a result, the theoretical study of large molecules or materials using ab initio methods such as coupled cluster is impractical. Hence, less costly methods involving approximations are generally employed at the cost of a loss in accuracy and predictive power. The emergence of quantum computing presents potential novel pathways for theoretical chemistry, as quantum resources show exponentially scaling computational power that could be harnessed to naturally encode and solve quantum problems. Although exponential speedup may not be achieved, a polynomial acceleration could be groundbreaking for quantum chemistry applications [1].\n\nIn this context, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) [2] was introduced as an effective algorithm to find the lowest eigenvalue of a quantum observable. In particular, it can compute the ground-state energy of a molecular Hamiltonian. The capability of VQE for electronic ground-state computation of small molecules has been extensively studied [3], but the effective and direct computation of excited states remains elusive.\n\nIn this study, we propose a variant of VQE that aims at computing molecular excited states. It uses the Folded Spectrum (FS) method to reorder the Hamiltonian's eigenspectrum, thus allowing for the direct computation of highly excited states. Although this method is documented in the literature, its quantum implementation was considered too costly due to the squared number of terms of the measured operator [4, 5]. Here, we show that a Pauli grouping procedure reduces the required number of measurements, thereby making the cost of the FS method reasonable. The effect of Pauli grouping is particularly significant for second quantized molecular Hamiltonians as a result of their particular structure. Finally, we present FS-VQE results obtained on a noisy quantum simulator, and show the successful use of quantum error mitigation techniques on this algorithm.\n\n## II. VARIATIONAL QUANTUM EIGENSOLVER\n\nThe Variational Quantum Eigensolver [2] is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm (see figure 1). Its purpose is to find the lowest eigenvalue of a given quantum operator. It can be applied to quantum chemistry problems to obtain the electronic ground-state of a molecule, by focusing on the molecular Hamiltonian H\u02c6 .\n\nThe algorithm relies on an ansatz to prepare a trial electronic wavefunction on the quantum computer. The ansatz takes the form of a parametric quantum circuit whose parameters, denoted \u03b8, are angles in rotation gates. Details on the ansatz design are given in section II A.\n\nThe quantum subroutine prepares a parametric trial wavefunction \u03a8(\u03b8) on a qubit register. This quantum state can be assessed by measuring the qubits : from the measurement results, the expectation value of\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFigure 1: Principle of VQE algorithm\n</F>\n\nthe molecular Hamiltonian \u27e8H\u02c6 \u27e9 can be computed on a classical computer (see section IV A). This value corresponds to the average electronic energy of the trial wavefunction \u03a8(\u03b8). A classical optimizer is then used to adjust the parameters \u03b8 in the ansatz in order to minimise the value of \u27e8H\u02c6 \u27e9. By means of the variational principle, the minimal expectation value obtained for a set of parameters \u03b8opt is an upper bound on the Hamiltonian's ground energy. The quantum state prepared with the optimal, final angles \u03b8opt is a representation of the molecule's ground-state electronic wavefunction.\nSource 6:\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.\nAnticipation that a useful quantum computer will be realized in the near future has motivated intense research into developing quantum algorithms which can potentially make progress on classically intractable computational problems. While many research areas expect to see transformative change with the development of such quantum devices, computational chemistry is poised to be among the first domains to significantly benefit from such new technologies. Due to the exponential growth in the size of the Hilbert space with increasing orbitals, a quantum computer with tens of qubits could potentially surpass classical algorithms1,2,3. Achieving such a capability depends not only on the quality of the qubits, but also critically on the efficiency of the algorithms.\nSchematic depiction of the ADAPT-VQE algorithm described presented. Since step 1 occurs on classical hardware, it is not included in the illustration.\\(\\vec \\theta ^{(n)}\\)is the list of ansatz parameters at thenth iteration. The number of parameters,\\(len(\\vec \\theta ^{(n)})\\), is equal to the number of operators in the ansatz. \u201cOperator Pool\u201d refers to the collection of operators which are used to grow the ansatz one-at-a-time. Each\\(\\tau _p^q\\)represents a generalized single or double excitation, and these operators are then spin-complemented. The orbital indices refer to spatial orbitals, and the overbar indicates\u03b2spin. Orbital indices without overbars have\u03b1spin. Note that growing the ansatz does not drain the pool, and so operators can show up multiple times if selected by the algorithm\nAs described above and illustrated in Fig.1, each iteration starts as a series of uncoupled experiments to obtain the parameter gradients via measurements of operator commutators (the gradient expression in step 5 is derived in section IB of theSupplemental Information). The purpose of these gradient measurements is to determine the best operator with which to grow the ansatz, as the operator with the largest gradient is likely to recover the most correlation energy in the subsequent VQE minimization. This process is continued iteratively, until a convergence threshold is met. In the classical numerical examples presented below, we chose to consider theL2norm of the gradient vector to determine convergence. This is just one possibility, and alternative convergence indicators could be used instead in step 6. At convergence, the ADAPT-VQE algorithm obtains the following ansatz:\nwhere the identity of each\\(\\hat \\tau _i\\)is determined by the algorithm.\nThe re-optimization subroutine in step 8 can be implemented on either a classical or quantum processor using any of the gradient- or non-gradient-based optimization routines that have been proposed or demonstrated for VQE12,15,16,18. Note that this subroutine is distinct from the gradient computed in step 5 of the algorithm. Additional possible modifications to the algorithm are mentioned in the \u201cDiscussion\u201d section.\nThe evaluation of all the gradient terms could in principle be achieved in a NISQ-friendly, highly parallel manner with a large number of uncoupled quantum computers all tasked with preparing the same state and measuring a different operator. This is the same potential for parallelization that the underlying VQE subroutine has. Just as with the original motivation for VQE, ADAPT-VQE decreases the circuit depth at the expense of a larger number of measurements. In our case a sequence of VQE experiments is performed, with the most resource-demanding experimental steps happening at the end. This constitutes a rather large prefactor which would scale with the size of the system, but the crucial advantage is controllability over the ansatz accuracy (in principle approaching FCI). Because the number of non-zero parameters equals the number of iterations, in order to discover an ansatz for a large system, an equal number of VQE re-optimizations will need to be performed. One strategy to minimize this prefactor could simply be to add a few operators at a time.\nDetermining resource requirements for adaptive procedures is rather difficult. The classical resources are not expected to be significant in the foreseeable future. However, as quantum technology progresses toward deeper circuits, the parameter manipulation and updating on a classical computer could become costly. However, we expect the dependence between parameters at the beginning and end of the ADAPT-VQE circuit to decay with circuit depth, such that one could imagine freezing the early parameters after a certain number of iterations. This would possibly establish an approach for FCI with only a polynomial number of variables, completely avoiding any exponential cost for the classical hardware.\nIn this section, we explore the convergence properties of the ADAPT-VQE algorithm with a few small molecular systems, LiH, BeH2, and linear H6. The former two molecules have been simulated using quantum hardware18,20. H6is included as a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which allows us to test the ADAPT-VQE approach for systems which are not well described with unitary coupled cluster.\nIn order to perform the simulations, an in-house code w\nSource 7:\nQuantum computing employs quantum algorithms designed for quantum computers, leveraging quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. These algorithms differ from classical ones by exploiting quantum properties to potentially solve problems faster. Key quantum algorithms include Shor's for factoring, which outperforms classical methods, and Grover's for searching unsorted databases, offering quadratic speedups. Other notable algorithms include the quantum Fourier transform, used in various quantum algorithms, and the Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms, which demonstrate quantum speedups for specific problems. Quantum algorithms can be categorized by techniques like phase kick-back and amplitude amplification or by problem types such as the hidden subgroup problem. Despite their potential, quantum computers cannot solve undecidable problems. Quantum algorithms also find applications in simulating quantum systems and solving linear systems more efficiently than classical methods. Hybrid quantum/classical algorithms combine quantum processing with classical optimization for tasks like finding ground state energies in molecules.\n\nThe chunk is: Contracted quantum eigensolver \nThe CQE algorithm minimizes the residual of a contraction (or projection) of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation onto the space of two (or more) electrons to find the ground- or excited-state energy and two-electron reduced density matrix of a molecule.

INTRODUCTION\n\nQuantum chemical calculations (QCC) are computational techniques to analyze the characteristics and structures of molecules, which have been applied in drug discovery and material development [1], [2]. It is a basis task in QCC to calculate the ground-state energies of molecules based on the electronic *Schrodinger \u00a8* equation, because the characteristic of a target molecule can be analyzed based on the ground-state energies with its different structures.\n\nCoupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] is well known as a traditional gold standard algorithm in QCC because of its high accuracy with moderate computational cost [3]. It calculates an electron correlation energy by explicitly treating single and double excitations through an iterative process [4] and adding the approximate treatment of triple excitations based on the perturbation theory.\n\nRecently, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers have been developed intensively [5], [6], and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is regarded as one of the most promising algorithms operating on NISQ computers. VQE is a variational hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver and can be used to calculate the ground-state energies of molecules [7], [8]. It iteratively executes a parameterized quantum circuit on a quantum device and updates its parameters using a classical optimizer until the energy calculated from the measurement\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_0_Figure_11.jpeg</img>\nFig. 1: The overview of our proposed automatic algorithm switching (AAS) technique.\n</F>\n\nresult of the quantum circuit converges. The accuracy of VQE strongly depends on an *ansatz*; especially, the unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) is a well-known chemistry-inspired ansatz which can achieve a high accuracy in QCC [3], [9].\n\nThe advantage between CCSD(T) and VQE in terms of the accuracy of ground-state energy calculation differs depending on molecular structures. CCSD(T) is basically accurate for stable structures where electron correlation is weak, but not for unstable structures where electron correlation is strong [10]. In contrast, VQE with the UCCSD ansatz (UCCSD-VQE) can represent strong electron correlation accurately [11].\n\nIn this work, we propose an *automatic algorithm switching (AAS)* technique to accurately calculate the ground-state energies of a target molecule with different bond distances. As shown in Figure 1, it automatically switches CCSD(T) and VQE according to bond distances by identifying a bond distance where the accuracy of CCSD(T) begins to drop for a target molecule. For this, we devise a novel method to detect the accuracy drop of CCSD(T) based on its number of iterations.\n\nOur evaluation using a noise-less quantum computer simulator demonstrates that AAS improves the accuracy to describe the bond breaking processes of four molecules, compared to the cases where CCSD(T) or VQE is solely used. Moreover, AAS reduces the error to calculate bond dissociation energy (BDE) by up to over an order of magnitude.\n\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we first explain QCC, CCSD(T), and VQE. Then, we investigate\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFig. 2: An example to describe the bond breading process of the H2 molecule.\n</F>\n\nthe accuracy of CCSD(T) and VQE.

INTRODUCTION\n\nQuantum chemistry is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing [1, 2]. Several quantum algorithms have been developed to address the electronic structure problem [3].

This review focuses on recent advancements in measurement techniques designed to efficiently extract information from quantum computers.\n\nOur primary focus is on measurement methods tailored to solving the electronic structure problem in its second quantized form on current and near-future quantum hardware. Much of the existing research has concentrated on ground-state energy estimations, which already have potential industrial applications [4]. We also explore techniques for measuring excited states and calculating oneand two-electron properties.\n\nMost measurement schemes have been developed within the framework of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) [5], where the expectation value of the electronic Hamiltonian is calculated. In VQE, a trial state |\u03a6\u27e9 is optimized based on its energy, \u27e8\u03a6| H\u02c6 |\u03a6\u27e9. However, measuring this expectation value is challenging because the electronic Hamiltonian, H\u02c6 , contains approximately \u223c N4 Pauli product terms, where N is the number of\n\nqubits or spin orbitals.\n\nThe rise in popularity of VQE stems from the limitations of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm [6, 7], which cannot be implemented on near-term (NISQ) devices due to the high circuit depth required, leading to significant error accumulation [8, 9]. While QPE is infeasible for NISQ hardware, its more sophisticated measurement schemes are expected to become viable with advances in gate fidelities and error-correction capabilities. Thus, this review also considers QPE-based measurement schemes, assuming the emergence of fault-tolerant quantum computing in the future.\n\nIn both VQE and QPE, a state close to the eigenstate of interest, |\u03a6\u27e9, is prepared. To measure any non-trivial property O\u02c6, an additional unitary rotation U\u02c6 is applied, producing the modified state U\u02c6 |\u03a6\u27e9. Measuring the Pauli single qubit z\u02c6 operators for U\u02c6 |\u03a6\u27e9 provides an estimate of \u27e8\u03a6| O\u02c6 |\u03a6\u27e9. Consequently, a central theme of this review is the construction of U\u02c6 for obtaining estimates of quantities of interest.\n\nWe focus on three key aspects of measurement schemes based on U\u02c6:\n\n- 1. The classical pre-processing cost of generating U\u02c6 for a specific observable.\n- 2. The quantum circuit implementation cost of U\u02c6.\n- 3. The number of measurements required to achieve a desired accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, for pre-error-corrected algorithms, we consider opportunities for error mitigation leveraging properties of U\u02c6, such as conserved symmetries.\nSource 10:\n# arXiv:2310.04215v1 [quant-ph] 6 Oct 2023\n\n\n\n# A combined quantum-classical method applied to material design: optimization and discovery of photochromic materials for photopharmacology applications\n\nQi Gao,1, 2, \u2217 Michihiko Sugawara,2 Paul D.

In this work, we develop a combined quantum-classical computing scheme involving the computational-basis Variational Quantum Deflation (cVQD) method for calculating excited states of a general classical Hamiltonian, such as Ising Hamiltonian. We apply this scheme to the practical use case of generating photochromic diarylethene (DAE) derivatives for photopharmacology applications. Using a data set of 384 DAE derivatives quantum chemistry calculation results, we show that a factorization-machine-based model can construct an Ising Hamiltonian to accurately predict the wavelength of maximum absorbance of the derivatives, \u03bbmax, for a larger set of 4096 DAE derivatives. A 12-qubit cVQD calculation for the constructed Ising Hamiltonian provides the ground and first four excited states corresponding to five DAE candidates possessing large \u03bbmax. On a quantum simulator, results are found to be in excellent agreement with those obtained by an exact eigensolver. Utilizing error suppression and mitigation techniques, cVQD on a real quantum device produces results with accuracy comparable to the ideal calculations on a simulator. Finally, we show that quantum chemistry calculations for the five DAE candidates provides a path to achieving large \u03bbmax and oscillator strengths by molecular engineering of DAE derivatives. These findings pave the way for future work on applying hybrid quantum-classical approaches to large system optimization and the discovery of novel materials.\n\n### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nUnprecedented improvements in the cost-effectiveness ratio of computers, together with improved computational techniques, enables quantum chemistry calculations to be widely applied in material design for finding novel molecules that have desirable properties [1\u20133]. On the other hand, since the number of candidate molecules is numerous, even utilizing supercomputing resources, it is time consuming to screen all molecules with ab initio calculations. Over the last 10 years, the use of machine learning and optimization methods to search for optimal molecular candidates in large chemical spaces has greatly accelerated [4] as the computational cost of these methods is several orders of magnitude lower than corresponding ab initio methods.\n\nHowever, although using machine learning and optimization methods for material design shows great promise, there are fundamental problems associated with these methods that will need to be overcome before mainstream usage. One issue is related to the size and quality of data sets used for training machine learning models derived from quantum chemistry calculations. Due to the chemical diversity in standard data sets, the prediction of molecular properties from a data set trained by a machine learning model derived from differing data sources is challenging. Specifically, it has been shown that some under represented functional groups in the golden standard quantum chemistry-based QM9 data set [5] is the primary source of outliers in property prediction [6]. Increasing the training data set size may improve the ability of machine learning models to predict molecular properties, however, such improvements come at the cost of requiring significantly more computational resources.\n\nAnother issue relates to the difficulties inherent in searching a large chemical space with discrete optimization methods. For example, while the number of potential drug-like molecules is estimated to be between 1023 and 1060, the number of all the synthesized molecules is \u223c 108 [7]. Since this small synthesized chemistry space is not a faithful representation of the full molecular space, finding an optimal target from this reduced data set is a difficult task. Moreover, since brute force search is not tractable for large data sets, efficient heuristic algorithms, such as simulated annealing [8] and Genetic algorithms [9], are needed to find the solution in a reasonable amount of time.

      "response_tokens": 1141,
      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to design a quantum error correction code that can handle both bit-flip and phase-flip errors at the same time. I remember that in quantum computing, errors can be tricky because of the fragile nature of qubits. So, I need to find something that can detect and correct these types of errors without messing up other stuff.\n\nFirst, I think about what kind of codes exist for multiple error types. I know there are things like surface codes and surface code variants, but those seem more advanced. I'm not sure if they handle all kinds of errors or just specific ones. Maybe I should look into stabilizer codes since they're a common approach in quantum error correction.\n\nI recall that stabilizer codes work by using logical operators to detect when something wrong is happening. If I can find operators that account for both bit-flip and phase-flip, maybe that's the key. Bit-flips are like Pauli X errors, and phase-flips are Pauli Z errors. So, I need an operator that includes both of these.\n\nWait, what about using a combination of Pauli matrices in my stabilizer generators? For example, if I have something like (X\u2297I + I\u2297Z)/\u221a2, does that cover both X and Z? That might be a good start because it can detect errors caused by either bit-flip or phase-flip. But I also need to make sure the code is self-orthogonal so that stabilizers are independent. How do I check if two operators commute?\n\nI think about using the commutator test. If AB equals BA, then they commute and are independent. So, for my X\u2297I + I\u2297Z operator and another one like Z\u2297X - X\u2297Z, I should compute their product in both orders to see if they're equal. If they are, then they can be included as stabilizers.\n\nLet me try that with the example operators:\nOperator 1: (X\u2297I + I\u2297Z)/\u221a2\nOperator 2: (Z\u2297X - X\u2297Z)/\u221a2\n\nMultiplying Operator 1 by Operator 2 and vice versa. If both give the same result, then they commute.\n\nOnce these stabilizers are independent, I can use them to detect errors that affect both bit and phase. But wait, how do I actually implement this? Do I just apply all possible Pauli combinations in my code space? Or is there a better way?\n\nI also remember about the surface codes but maybe the surface code doesn't handle multiple errors efficiently because it might require checking all four corners for each error type. That could complicate things.\n\nAnother idea is to use a larger stabilizer group that includes both X and Z terms. For example, using a group generated by X\u2297I + I\u2297Z and something else like Z\u2297I - I\u2297Z. This would make sure any single-qubit errors affecting two qubits are caught.\n\nWait, maybe I can construct the code space by taking tensor products of certain Pauli operators that cover both bit and phase flips. Something like (X\u2297I + I\u2297Z) acting on each qubit in a larger system. That way, when an error occurs, it would change this stabilizer generator, leading to an error syndrome.\n\nSo putting it all together: create a quantum code space where the logical operators include both X and Z terms for each qubit. Then, design stabilizers based on combinations that detect these combined errors. This should cover both bit-flips and phase-flips simultaneously without messing up other operations.\n\nI think I've got the gist of it. Now, to write this out step by step.\n</think>\n\nTo design a quantum error correction code that can handle both bit-flip (X) and phase-flip (Z) errors simultaneously, we can employ stabilizer codes using operators that encompass both types of Pauli matrices. Here's a structured approach:\n\n1. **Choose Appropriate Stabilizers**: Select stabilizer operators that include combinations of X and Z terms to detect combined errors:\n   - Operator 1: \\( \\frac{X \\otimes I + I \\otimes Z}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) (covers bit-flips)\n   - Operator 2: \\( \\frac{Z \\otimes X - X \\otimes Z}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) (covers phase-flips)\n\n2. **Check Commutativity**: Ensure that the chosen operators are independent by verifying commutativity:\n   - Compute \\( A B \\) and \\( B A \\). If they yield the same result, the operators commute.\n\n3. **Construct Error Detection Codes**: Use these operators to form stabilizer generators in the quantum code space.\n\n4. **Implement Code Space**: The logical operators are constructed by combining X and Z terms across all qubits in a larger system. This ensures that any single-qubit errors affecting two qubits are detected.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA suitable quantum error correction code can be designed using stabilizer generators that include combinations of Pauli matrices for both bit-flip (X) and phase-flip (Z) errors. By choosing operators such as \\( \\frac{X \\otimes I + I \\otimes Z}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) and ensuring their commutativity, the code can efficiently detect and correct these combined errors without compromising other operations."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this quantum communication paper. It's a bit dense, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The system uses entangled photons that get noisy through optical fibers. They send these photons as carriers for information and measure them with homodyne detection. I remember homodyne is like measuring in one of the measurement directions, so it's not as precise as heterodyne but still useful for estimating parameters.\n\nThe main issue here is photon noise: each photon hits the fiber multiple times on average. The number of photons per unit distance has a Poisson distribution, which means most fibers are empty, and some have more on average based on G. So in the experiments with OUN (Ohmic) and RTN (resonant tunneling) noise, they're seeing how well they can correct for errors.\n\nThey talk about error correction using a concatenated code: outer three-qubit phase-flip code and inner two-qubit bit-flip code. I've heard about quantum error correction before; it's like encoding the data in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected without disturbing the encoded information. The logical states they have look complex, but maybe each photon is part of these qubits which are entangled.\n\nThe success probability Psuccess shows how often their error correction works over time. They vary \u00b5, the correlation parameter, which affects non-Markovian dynamics. From the figure description, I think as \u00b5 increases, Psuccess goes up, which might be because they keep more correlations to maintain errors or something.\n\nI'm a bit confused about what exactly happens when they increase \u00b5 beyond 1. If it's above 1, that would mean the fibers are in an anti-Ohmic regime? Not sure if that makes sense, but maybe beyond that, things change differently. Still, the success rate keeps increasing up to certain points.\n\nThe paper mentions \"correlated non-Markovian quantum channels.\" I know that correlation can affect how information propagates through the channel because each photon is not entirely independent anymore; they share some entanglement or influence each other. Non-Markovian means the noise might depend on the past, so it's a memory effect which complicates things.\n\nThey also talk about the quantum speed limit and channel capacity. I've heard of that before; the quantum speed limit is like how fast information can be transmitted, considering the entanglement entropy over time. Channel capacity would be the maximum rate at which you can send information through this channel without errors. So maybe their experiments are testing these limits?\n\nThe concatenated code with three and two qubits seems efficient because it uses more redundancy for error correction. Each photon contributes to multiple qubits, making the encoding more robust against noise. The error correction success would depend on how well they can distinguish between different states when some photons hit the fiber multiple times.\n\nI'm also noticing that even after certain noise levels, the concatenated code still works pretty well. That suggests the code is quite resilient. But as \u00b5 increases further, maybe the effectiveness starts to wane or require more resources? Not sure yet.\n\nThe success probability plot has oscillatory behavior for RTN (resonant tunneling) noise and a smoother curve for OUN. I think RTN noise has more fluctuations because of its nature, so it might produce more oscillations, while OUN being Ohmic is more like coherent propagation without interference, which could lead to less variation.\n\nThe success rate reaches 100% at different times or under specific \u00b5. That's impressive, showing that their error correction method can effectively handle the noise despite correlations and non-Markovian dynamics. The figure shows how it stabilizes over time as the system tries to correct errors.\n\nI wonder about the practical implications. If you have correlated photon losses, especially in anti-Ohmic regimes, does that affect quantum communication? It might require different error correction strategies or more robust codes because of the noise structure. Their work could be useful for designing systems that can handle such noise better by using these concatenated codes.\n\nAlso, I'm curious about how exactly the concatenated code works in terms of encoding and decoding. Each photon contributes to multiple qubits, so maybe it's a form of network coding where information is spread out across multiple nodes (photon qubits) before being processed together. That way, errors can be more easily identified and corrected collectively.\n\nIn summary, this paper seems to show that by using efficient error correction with specific entangled systems, you can maintain good communication even when photon losses are correlated in non-Markovian ways. The use of concatenated codes and their varying success probabilities under different noise types (ONU vs RTN) indicate a promising approach for future quantum communication protocols.\n</think>\n\nThe paper discusses the robustness of error correction using concatenated three-qubit phase-flip and two-qubit bit-flip codes to protect entangled photons against photon noise. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Error Correction Mechanism**: The concatenation of these codes allows for efficient error detection and correction, enabling logical encoding of information despite photon losses. Each photon contributes to multiple qubits, creating redundancy that enhances error resilience.\n\n2. **Noise Types and Success Rate**: \n   - On resonance (ONU), the concatenated code shows oscillatory success probabilities due to RTN noise fluctuations.\n   - In anti-Ohmic (RTN) regimes, the system stabilizes faster, reaching 100% success at lower photon loss rates.\n\n3. **Quantum Speed Limit and Channel Capacity**: The study explores how non-Markovian noise impacts information transmission speed (quantum speed limit) and channel capacity, offering insights into optimizing quantum communication protocols under such conditions.\n\n4. **Correlated Effects**: The use of concatenated codes addresses the challenges posed by correlated photon losses, suggesting that future protocols may employ similar strategies for improved robustness against noise structures.\n\n5. **Practical Implications**: Efficient error correction methods like these are crucial for quantum communication, especially in environments with complex noise structures such as anti-Ohmic regimes.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper highlights a promising approach using concatenated codes to maintain reliable information transmission despite photon losses, offering practical insights for future quantum communication systems.",

Quantum Error Correction\n\nQuantum error correction (QEC) is a procedure to protect the quantum information from unwanted environmental noise [11][12]. QEC forms one of the most important aspects of quantum computation, and we can safely say that quantum computers would be of no practical use without QEC. Among all the unwanted noise encountered in quantum computation the most prevalent and difficult to correct is decoherence [13]. In decoherence, due to the interaction between the environment and the quantum device, quantum information gets nonlocally correlated with the environment. Practically, that means loss of quantum information. Errors due to decoherence degrade the quantum information quickly and render a quantum computer useless. Apart from decoherence, qubit flip and phase error also occurs during quantum computation. Qubit flip error corresponds to applying an X-quantum gate on the state written in the computational basis states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. It is analogous to bit flip error in classical error correction. Qubit phase error introduces a relative phase of \u03c0 between the basis states of the qubit and corresponds to applying a Z-quantum gate on the state. From quantum mechanics, we know that, unlike the global\n\nphase, relative phases are important as they change the state, and hence the probability density, of the system. There is no analog of phase errors in classical error correction.\n\n### 2.1. Difficulties faced while correcting quantum errors\n\nThe first complication we face while correcting quantum errors is that there is no way to protect the quantum information by making extra copies of it, as done in classical coding schemes. No-cloning theorem prohibits making a copy of the qubit thus making quantum error correction difficult to implement.\n\nThe second complication is that quantum computers are susceptible to both bit (X) flip and phase (Z)-flip errors. We should be able to correct both errors simultaneously. But since there is no classical analog of phase flip errors it is hard to devise a quantum error correcting code that allows us to achieve simultaneous correction of both X- and Z-errors.\n\nThe last complication is due to the fact that we cannot measure qubits without losing quantum information. The problem of wavefunction collapse due to measurement renders quantum error correction hard to achieve as we would not be able to detect and correct errors without measuring the qubits. We will see in the later sections how stabilizer formalism allows us to overcome this complication.\n\n### 2.2. Quantum error-correcting codes\n\nDespite the obstacles, it turns out that quantum error correction is possible. Quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) can be viewed as a mapping from k qubits to n qubits, that is, it maps a Hilbert space of 2 k dimensions to a Hilbert space of 2 n dimensions. The extra n \u2212 k qubits allow us to store the information stored in the k logical qubits in a redundant manner, thereby protecting it from errors. The basic principles required to construct a QECC are: 1) To construct a code it is necessary to have an idea of the errors that we want to correct; 2) The principle of redundant information is used in QECC. If a part of the resource is damaged by errors, the logical qubit can still be accurately recovered from the rest of the redundant qubits.\n\nWe already saw in the previous section the types of errors that may occur in quantum computation. One of the four possible things can happen to the qubit: nothing (I), qubit flip (X), phase flip (Z), or both (Y = iXZ). In an n-qubit Hilbert space, the evolution of qubit can be expanded in terms of the operators Pn = {I, X, Y, Z} \u2297n . Thus, we can express the action of a unitary operator (U) on n-qubits and their environment as\n\n$$\\mathbf{U}:|\\psi\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle_{E}\\rightarrow\\sum_{a}\\mathbf{E}_{a}|\\psi\\rangle\\otimes|e_{a}\\rangle_{E}\\tag{2}$$\n\nwhere Ea \u2208 Pn are the n-qubit Pauli operator, a runs over all 2 2n possible combinations of Pn and |ea\u27e9E are the states of the environment. Some important properties of the Pauli group Pn are:\n\n- Each element of Pn is unitary.\n- \u2200M \u2208 Pn; M2 = I or M2 = \u2212I\n- Any two elements M, N \u2208 Pn either commute, i.e., [M, N] = 0, or anticommute, i.e., {M, N} = 0.\n\nTo understand how to construct a QECC we will first define some important quantities:\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [11] Frank Gaitan.

Then a classical oracle U is a unitary transformation of the form\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}{{U\\left|x\\right\\rangle\\left(\\frac{\\left|0\\right\\rangle-\\left|1\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)=\\left|x\\right\\rangle\\left(\\frac{\\left|0\\oplus f(x)\\right\\rangle-\\left|1\\oplus f(x)\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}}\\\\ {{\\Leftrightarrow U\\left|x\\right\\rangle\\left|-\\right\\rangle=(-1)^{f(x)}\\left|x\\right\\rangle\\left|-\\right\\rangle.}}\\end{array}$$\n\nSince the ancillary qubit is left untouched by this operation, we refrain from writing it and simply say U |x\u27e9 = (\u22121)f(x) |x\u27e9. Frequently, we use a classical oracle UA as a means for checking membership in some subset A in the following sense\n\n$$U_{A}\\left|x\\right\\rangle=\\begin{cases}-\\left|x\\right\\rangle,&\\text{if}x\\in A\\\\ \\left|x\\right\\rangle,&\\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}$$\n\nAs noted in [AC12], we can implement UA as a projector PA. To do this, we initialize a control qubit |+\u27e9 to control the application of UA to |x\u27e9. After this, we measure the control qubit in the Hadamard basis. If the outcome is |\u2212\u27e9, then x \u2208 A, otherwise x /\u2208 A. Indeed,\n\n$$C U_{A}(\\left|x\\right\\rangle,\\left|+\\right\\rangle)={\\frac{\\left|x\\right\\rangle\\left|0\\right\\rangle+U_{A}\\left|x\\right\\rangle\\left|1\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}}={\\begin{cases}\\left|x\\right\\rangle\\left|-\\right\\rangle&{\\mathrm{if~}}x\\in A\\\\ \\left|x\\right\\rangle\\left|+\\right\\rangle&{\\mathrm{if~}}x\\notin A.\\end{cases}}$$\n\nNote that, unless otherwise stated, a classical oracle can be queried in a quantum superposition.\n\n## 2.3 Quantum error correction and CSS codes\n\nIn this section, we follow [NC10] to review a well-known category of quantum error correcting codes known as Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. Before proceeding, it is worth pointing out that we focus on correcting bit-flip (Pauli-X) errors and phase-flip (Pauli-Z) errors. This is sufficient because, by the discretization of quantum errors, the ability to correct bit- and phase-flip errors means that an arbitrary quantum error can be corrected.\n\nCSS codes can be constructed from classical linear codes. An [n, k] classical linear code C that encodes k bits into an n-bit codespace is specified by an n \u00d7 k generator matrix G whose entries are elements of Z2 = {0, 1}. The columns of G are linearly independent and span the codespace.\n\nEquivalently, an [n, k] code can be defined as the kernel of an (n \u2212 k) \u00d7 n matrix H whose entries are elements of Z2. That is, the codespace consists of all x \u2208 {0, 1} n such that Hx = 0. The matrix H is known as a parity check matrix.\n\nThe distance of a code C is defined as\n\n$$d(C):=\\operatorname*{min}_{x,y\\in C,x\\neq y}d(x,y).$$\n\nwhere d(x, y) is the Hamming distance. Since d(x, y) = wt(x + y), where wt(\u00b7) is the Hamming weight, we equivalently have\n\n$d(C)=\\min\\limits_{x\\in C,x\\neq0}$ wt($x$).  \n\nIf a code has distance d \u2265 2q + 1 for some integer q, then the code is able to correct up to q errors (for a noisy codeword y \u2032 , there is a unique codeword y that is within Hamming distance q of y \u2032 ).\n\nGiven an [n, k] classical linear code C with generator matrix G and parity check matrix H, one can define the dual of C, denoted as C \u22a5, as the code with generator matrix HT and parity check matrix GT .\n\nFor quantum codes, we use double square brackets [[n, k]] to differentiate from classical codes [n, k]. Now suppose C1 and C2 are [n, k1] and [n, k2] classical linear codes with the property that C2 \u2286 C1, and C1 and C \u22a5 2 both correct q errors. The CSS code, constructed from C1 and C2, is then an [[n, k1 \u2212 k2]] quantum code that can correct arbitrary errors on up to q qubits (though the code can actually correct up to q bit-flip and q phase-flip errors).\n\nCodewords in the CSS code are of the form\n\n$$w+C_{2}\\rangle\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|C_{2}|}}\\sum_{v\\in C_{2}}|w+v\\rangle\\,,\\tag{8}$$\n\nwhere w \u2208 C1. Note that since C2 \u2286 C1, w + v \u2208 C1. It is useful to observe the effect of a Hadamard transform on such a codeword,\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|C_{2}^{\\perp}|}}\\sum_{z\\in C_{2}^{\\perp}}(-1)^{w\\cdot z}\\,|z\\rangle\\,.$$\n\nBit-flip errors are described be an n-bit vector e1 with 1s where bit-flips have occurred and 0s otherwise. Similarly, phase-flip errors are described by a vector e2. Then the noisy state is\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|C_{2}|}}\\sum_{v\\in C_{2}}(-1)^{(w+v)\\cdot e_{2}}\\left|w+v+e_{1}\\right>,$$\n\nError correction proceeds as follows. First, bit-flips are dealt with by applying the parity check matrix HC1 for the code C1 and storing the result in ancilla qubits; measuring the ancilla qubits yields an error syndrome HC1 e1 that can be classically processed to determine an appropriate correction operation. After correction, the state is\n\n$${\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|C_{2}|}}}\\sum_{v\\in C_{2}}(-1)^{(w+v)\\cdot e_{2}}\\left|w+v\\right>,$$\n\nFor phase-flip errors, we apply a Hadamard transform to yield\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|C_{2}^{\\perp}|}}\\sum_{z\\in C_{\\frac{1}{2}}}(-1)^{w\\cdot z}\\,|z+e_{2}\\rangle\\,,$$\n\nand so we can now treat the phase-flip errors as bit-flips. We apply the parity check matrix HC\u22a5 2 for C \u22a5 2 and obtain the error syndrome HC\u22a5 2 e2. After correction, another Hadamard transform is applied to return the state to the original codeword.\n\nLet EX (EZ) denote the set of error vectors that corresponds to bit-flip (phase-flip) errors affecting up to q out of n qubits:\n\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{X}=\\{e\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}:\\mathrm{wt}(e)\\leq q\\}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\mathcal{E}_{Z}=\\{e^{\\prime}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}:\\mathrm{wt}(e^{\\prime})\\leq q\\}.\\tag{9}$$\n\nFor a CSS code that corrects up to q bit-flip and q phase-flip errors (i.e., up to q arbitrary errors), let Eq denote the set of all correctable error vectors,\n\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{q}:=\\{(e,e^{\\prime}):e,e^{\\prime}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}\\text{and wt}(e)\\leq q\\text{and wt}(e^{\\prime})\\leq q\\}.\\tag{10}$$\n\nWe can easily see that\n\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{q}|=|\\mathcal{E}_{X}|\\cdot|\\mathcal{E}_{Z}|=\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{q}\\binom{n}{j}\\right)^{2}.\\tag{11}$$\n\nWith slight abuse of notation, we sometimes drop the q subscript on Eq.\n\n#### 2.3.1 CSS code as a stabilizer code\n\nStabilizer codes [Got97] form an important class of quantum error correction codes. In this section, we use [Got97, NC10, Fuj15, Rof19] to briefly review the stabilizer formalism so that we may view CSS codes from this perspective.\nSource 3:\n## **3 CONVENTIONAL QEC METHODS**\n\nConventional QEC methods encode logical quantum information into entangled states of multiple physical qubits. The approach enables the detection and correction of errors without directly measuring the quantum information itself. This section offers a detailed overview of coventional QEC techniques, covering commonly used error correction codes, stabilizer formalism, and the processes of syndrome measurement and decoding.\n\n#### **3.1 Conventional QEC Codes**\n\nSeveral QEC codes have been developed to safeguard quantum information from errors caused by decoherence, noise, and imperfections in quantum gates. These codes are essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. Due to space constraints, we focus on three key QEC codes: Shor's code, Steane's code, and surface codes, highlighting their encoding processes, error correction mechanisms, and practical applications.\n\nThe **Shor code**, introduced by Peter Shor in 1995 [13], was the first QEC code. It encodes one logical qubit into nine physical qubits and can correct arbitrary single-qubit errors, including both bit-flip and phase-flip errors. The Shor code achieves this by combining two classical repetition codes: one for correcting bit-flip errors and another for correcting phase-flip errors. The logical qubit state |\u03c8L\u27e9 = \u03b1 |0L\u27e9 + \u03b2 |1L\u27e9 is initially encoded using a three-qubit repetition code for bit-flip protection, where |0L\u27e9 = |000\u27e9 and |1L\u27e9 = |111\u27e9. To protect against phase-flip errors, Hadamard gates are applied to each qubit, and the resulting state is further encoded with another three-qubit repetition code. This process results in a final nine-qubit encoded state capable of correcting any single-qubit error.\n\nError correction in the Shor code is performed by measuring stabilizer generators, which are specific quantum operators designed to detect errors without disturbing the encoded quantum information. These stabilizer measurements produce syndromes that indicate the presence of either bit-flip or phase-flip errors. Once an error is identified, appropriate quantum gates are applied to correct it, restoring the logical qubit [41].\n\nThe **Steane code**, proposed by Andrew Steane in 1996 [94], is a seven-qubit code derived from the classical *[7, 4, 3]* Hamming code. It is a prominent example of a CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) code, named after the developers of this class of codes [95], [96]. CSS codes are stabilizer codes constructed from classical linear codes that satisfy dual-containing properties, enabling separate correction of bit-flip and phase-flip errors. The logical qubit is encoded using codewords derived from the Hamming code:\n\n$$|0_{L}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\sum_{{\\bf x}\\in C}|{\\bf x}\\rangle\\,,\\quad|1_{L}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\sum_{{\\bf x}\\in C^{\\perp}\\setminus C}|{\\bf x}\\rangle\\,.\\tag{12}$$\n\nwhere C is the classical Hamming code, and C \u22a5 is its dual code. The codewords |x\u27e9 correspond to computational basis states representing the classical codewords. Steane's code offers the advantage of correcting any single-qubit error while using fewer physical qubits than the Shor code, making it more resource-efficient. Error correction in Steane's code is\n\nachieved by measuring stabilizer generators, which identify the presence and location of errors. Once the syndrome is determined, the error is corrected using the corresponding quantum operation [41].\n\n**Surface codes** are a class of topological QEC codes that have gained significant attention for their scalability and potential for practical implementation. Proposed by Alexei Kitaev in 2003 [97], surface codes encode logical qubits into a two-dimensional lattice of physical qubits arranged on a surface, with qubits interacting locally through nearestneighbor connections. This locality makes surface codes particularly well-suited for large-scale quantum computing, as physical qubits only need to interact with their immediate neighbors, simplifying hardware requirements.\n\nOne of the key advantages of surface codes is their relatively high error threshold, approximately 1%, meaning they can tolerate error rates of up to 1% before the error correction process becomes unreliable [14]. This robustness makes surface codes highly resilient to errors, especially compared to other codes that require significantly lower error rates. In surface codes, errors appear as defects in the qubit lattice, detected through stabilizer measurements. The error correction process involves identifying and correcting chains of errors, often using classical algorithms such as minimum-weight perfect matching [14], which efficiently determine the most likely error path connecting observed defects.\n\n## **3 CONVENTIONAL QEC METHODS**\n\nAnother significant advantage of surface codes is their scalability. The code distance, which determines the number of errors a code can detect and correct, increases with the size of the lattice. This means error correction capabilities can be enhanced by simply adding more physical qubits to the surface. Due to their scalability, robustness, and compatibility with current quantum hardware platforms such as superconducting qubits [46], [98].\n\n#### **3.2 Stabilizer Formalism**\n\nThe **stabilizer formalism**, developed by Daniel Gottesman [41], is a mathematical framework that describes a large class of QEC codes, including the Steane and surface codes. This formalism is based on stabilizer groups, which are abelian subgroups of the n-qubit **Pauli group** Pn. In the context of quantum computing, the Pauli group consists of all n-fold tensor products of the Pauli matrices {I, X, Y, Z} and the multiplicative factors {\u00b11, \u00b1i}. These operators form the basis for describing quantum errors and operations.\n\nA stabilizer code is defined by a set of k independent stabilizer generators {S1, S2, . . . , Sk}, where each Si \u2208 Pn satisfies the relation:\n\n$\\left|\\psi_{L}\\right\\rangle=\\left|\\psi_{L}\\right\\rangle,\\quad\\forall i,$ (13)\n\nfor any logical codeword |\u03c8L\u27e9. The code space is the simultaneous +1 eigenspace of all stabilizer generators.\n\nThe stabilizer formalism simplifies the description and analysis of quantum codes by expressing their properties in terms of stabilizer generators. This approach provides a unified framework for understanding and implementing various QEC codes, such as the Steane code and surface codes. It also facilitates the design of encoding and decoding circuits, allowing these codes to detect errors through stabilizer measurements without collapsing the encoded quantum information. This ensures the qubits' state remains within the valid code space.\n\nOne of the key advantages of the stabilizer formalism is its ability to perform QEC while preserving the integrity of logical qubits. The stabilizer generators function as checks on the quantum system, ensuring it remains in a valid code state. When errors occur, deviations from the expected stabilizer measurement results flag the errors. This enables the system to identify and correct errors while keeping the logical qubits unaffected.\n\n#### **3.3 Syndrome Measurement and Decoding**\n\n**Syndrome measurement** is the process of detecting quantum errors by measuring the stabilizer generators. These measurements produce syndromes, which reveal information about the type and location of errors without disturbing the quantum state. A syndrome is essentially a set of measurement outcomes indicating how the quantum state has deviated from the code space. The process involves the following steps:\n\n- 1) Stabilizer Measurements: Ancillary qubits are used to measure the stabilizers. Controlled operations entangle the data qubits with the ancillary qubits, which are then measured to extract the syndrome bits.\n- 2) Syndrome Extraction: The extracted syndrome bits form a pattern that identifies the presence and type of error, if any.\n- 3) Decoding: A decoding algorithm maps the syndrome to the corresponding error and determines the appropriate correction operation.\n- 4) Error Correction: The identified error is corrected using quantum gates, restoring the logical qubit to its intended state.\n\nDecoding algorithms are essential for interpreting syndromes and applying corrections. For smaller codes, precomputed lookup tables can be used to map each syndrome to its corresponding correction operation. While efficient for small systems, lookup tables become impractical for larger codes due to the exponential growth in the number of possible syndromes. For larger codes, such as surface codes, more advanced techniques like minimum-weight perfect matching are employed. This classical algorithm identifies the most probable error chain connecting observed defects in the qubit lattice, efficiently decoding the error pattern [14]. Minimum-weight perfect matching is particularly well-suited for surface codes because it leverages the local interactions between qubits in the lattice.\n\nAnother important approach is **belief propagation**, a message-passing algorithm used in probabilistic graphical models such as factor graphs and Bayesian networks [99]. In the context of QEC, belief propagation operates on the Tanner graph representation of a quantum code, where nodes represent qubits and checks (stabilizers), and edges represent their relationships [100]. The algorithm estimates the likelihood of various error patterns by iteratively updating and passing probability-based messages along the edges of the graph, informed by the observed syndromes.\n\nBelief propagation is particularly effective for quantum codes with sparse parity-check matrices, such as lowdensity parity-check (LDPC) codes [101]. It is well-suited for large-scale quantum systems where exact decoding is computationally infeasible. The iterative nature of the algorithm enables it to converge on a probable error estimate by leveraging local information, making it computationally efficient.\n\nHowever, belief propagation in QEC faces challenges due to quantum degeneracy, where multiple error patterns can produce the same syndrome [100]. To address this issue, modified approaches such as the quantum belief propagation algorithm incorporate degeneracy into the message updates.\n\nThe stabilizer formalism, combined with efficient decoding algorithms, forms the foundation of QEC, enabling faulttolerant quantum computation.\nSource 4:\n# Tapestry of dualities in decohered quantum error correction codes\n\nIn this paper, we focus on developing a general framework to study the error-corrupted mixed states in stabilizer codes decohered by Pauli noise, including bit-flip and phase-flip errors in particular. We systematically construct the statistical models arising from the R\u00b4enyi entropies SR for a general R and identify a rich set of duality relations that weave these statistical models into\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> These two authors contributed equally.\n\na \"tapestry of dualities\". Our discussion contains three major parts, focusing on three classes of translationinvariant stabilizer codes: (1) general Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, (2) CSS codes with an \"em symmetry\" between the X-type and the Z-type stabilizers, and (3) general stabilizer codes.\n\nWe first investigate general CSS codes decohered by bit-flip and phase-flip errors. The tapestry of dualities for this class of decohered codes is shown in Fig. 1. The two error types cause independent decoherence in a CSS code and are, hence, studied separately. The behavior of the decohered CSS code is intimately related to a pair of dual statistical models, named SM1 and SM2, which are obtained from ungauging the CSS code. Under bitflip errors, the R\u00b4enyi entropy SR of the error-corrupted mixed state is described by a pair of dual statistical models with randomness: (1) R-replica SM1 with real random couplings (rRC) and (2) R-replica SM2 with imaginary random couplings (iRC). These two statistical models are dual under a high-low-temperature (HLT) duality. Similarly, under phase-flip errors, SR is described by another pair of random statistical models: (1) R-replica SM1 with iRC and (2) R-replica SM2 with rRC, which are again HLT dual to each other. The patterns of randomness in these statistical models are interchanged as we switch from bit-flip errors to phase-flip errors. Additionally, for R = 2, 3, \u221e, we discover extra duality relations that map between (the random statistical models associated with) bit-flip and phase-flip errors. We call these dualities the bit-phase-decoherence (BPD) dualities. The random statistical models and the dualities provide powerful tools to study the phases and the DIPTs in the decohered CSS codes. We propose a conjecture on the monotonicity of the DIPTs' critical error rates as functions of the R\u00b4enyi index R, and discuss the alternative interpretation of the DIPT with R = 2 as a quantum phase transition in the doubled Hilbert space. We also discuss two concrete examples, the decohered 3D toric code [17] and the decohered X-cube model [18], demonstrating the abovementioned general results.\n\nWhen the CSS codes are endowed with additional symmetries, the duality structure under decoherence can be enriched. We analyze the case when the CSS codes have a symmetry that exchanges the X-type and Z-type stabilizers, which we dub \"electric-magnetic symmetry\" (em symmetry). Under the bit-flip and phase-flip errors, the tapestry of dualities of the em-symmetric CSS code is shown in Fig. 7, which is effectively the tapestry shown in Fig. 1 \"folded in half\" by the symmetry. The em symmetry interchanges the bit-flip and phase-flip errors. The original pair of dual statistical models SM1 and SM2 become the same model, call it SM, with a self-duality. Under either bit-flip or phase-flip errors, the R\u00b4enyi entropies SR are captured by a pair of statistical models with randomness: (1) R-replica SM with rRC and (2) Rreplica SM with iRC. They are related by the HLT duality for any R. The BPD dualities for R = 2, 3, \u221e (combined with the em symmetry) become self-dualities with\n\nsuper-universal self-dual error rates shared by all emsymmetric CSS codes in different dimensions. For a given em-symmetric CSS code (and a fixed R = 2, 3 or \u221e), if there is a unique DIPT of SR as the error rate varies, the critical error rate must coincide with the super-universal self-dual values. We demonstrate our general results in the concrete settings of the decohered 2D toric code [17], and the decohered Haah's code in 3D [19].\n\n# Tapestry of dualities in decohered quantum error correction codes\n\nFor general stabilizer codes, bit-flip and phase-flip errors are no longer special. We therefore consider the decoherence by general Pauli noise. The general decohered stabilizer codes are tied to a single statistical model SM, which is self-dual under an HLT duality. The R\u00b4enyi entropy SR of the decohered code is captured by both (1) the R-replica SM with rRC and (2) the R-replica SM with iRC, two random statistical models related by an HLT duality. Moreover, we find extra dualities between different error rates for R = 2, \u221e and call them \"general-Pauli-noise dualities\" (GPN dualities). The GPN dualities are the generalizations of the BPD dualities of decohered CSS codes. We obtain the surface of superuniversal self-dual error rates under the GPN dualities.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II focuses on the general CSS codes decohered by bit-flip and phase-flip errors. Sec. III discusses the decohered CSS codes with em symmetry. Sec. IV analyzes general stabilizer codes with general Pauli noise. We present our conclusion and outlook in Sec. V.\n\n### II. CSS CODE UNDER DECOHERENCE\n\nIn this section, we will first review the basics of general CSS codes and introduce the decoherence model that describes bit-flip and phase-flip errors. Next, we provide the general construction of the statistical models, the Rreplica SM1 and SM2 with randomness, that describe the R\u00b4enyi entropies SR of the error-corrupted mixed states of the decohered CSS code. We will address how the R \u2192 1 limit recovers the disordered statistical model that captures the code's error threshold for decodability. Then, we present the HLT and BPD dualities between these statistical models and the tapestry of dualities they form. The DIPTs are signaled by the singular behavior of the R\u00b4enyi entropies SR and, hence, are identified with the phase transitions in the random statistical models. For R = 2, by generalizing Ref. 15 and 20, we give an alternative interpretation of the DIPT as a quantum phase transition in the doubled Hilbert space. We also propose a conjecture on the monotonicity of the DIPTs' critical error rates as a function of the R\u00b4enyi index R. Finally, we study the decohered 3D toric code and the decohered X-cube model as concrete examples.\nSource 5:\nThis browser is no longer supported.\nUpgrade to Microsoft Edge to take advantage of the latest features, security updates, and technical support.\nThis article explains the basics of quantum error correction, the types of quantum errors, and some common quantum error correction codes. It also provides an example of how to correct errors using the three-qubit code.\nQuantum error correction (QEC) is a technique that allows us to protect quantum information from errors. Error correction is especially important in quantum computers, because efficient quantum algorithms make use of large-scale quantum computers, which are sensitive to noise.\nThe basic principle behind quantum error correction is that the number of bits used to encode a given amount of information is increased. This redundancy allows the code to detect and correct errors.\nThe error rates for quantum computers are typically higher than classical computer's errors due to the challenges associated with building and operating quantum systems. Noise, decoherence, and imperfections in quantum gates can cause errors in quantum computations. Current quantum computers have error rates in the range of 1% to 0.1%. In other words, this means that on average one out of every 100 to 1000 quantum gate operations results in an error.\nThere are two fundamental types of quantum errors: bit flips and phase flips.\nBit flip errors occur when a qubit changes from $\\ket{0}$ to $\\ket{1}$ or vice versa. Bit flip errors are also known as $\\sigma_x$-errors, because they map the qubit states $\\sigma_x \\ket{0} = \\ket{1}$ and $\\sigma_x \\ket{1} = \\ket{0}$. This error is analogous to a classical bit flip error.\nTo retrieve the error information, you measure the two auxiliary qubits in the computational basis states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$. By doing this, you recover the joint state, which is called theerror syndromebecause it helps diagnose the errors in the received qubits.\nNow you know which of the four possible states the three received qubits are in. You can correct the error by applying the correction operation. In this case you're dealing with bit flip errors, so the correction is a $\\sigma_x$ operation applied to one (or none) of the qubits.\nFor example, if the error syndrome is $\\ket{00}$, then the received qubits are in the state $\\alpha \\ket{000} + \\beta\\ket{111}$, which is the state you originally sent. If the error syndrome is $\\ket{11}$, then the received qubits are in the state $\\alpha \\ket{100} + b\\ket{011}$. There's a bit flip error on the first qubit, which you can correct by applying a $\\sigma_x$ operation to the first qubit.\nFinally, to extract the single qubit you wanted to transmit originally, you apply two CNOT operations: one uses the first qubit as control and acts on the second qubit, and other uses the first qubit as control and acts on the third one.\nThe state of the first qubit is now $\\alpha \\ket{0} + \\beta \\ket{1}$, which is the original qubit you wanted to transmit.\nThe QEC code doesn't gain any information regarding the coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, hence superpositions of the computational state remain intact during correction.\nSource 6:\nQuantum error correction(QEC) is a set of techniques used inquantum computingto protectquantum informationfrom errors due todecoherenceand otherquantum noise. Quantum error correction is theorised as essential to achievefault tolerant quantum computingthat can reduce the effects of noise on stored quantum information, faulty quantum gates, faulty quantum state preparation, and faulty measurements. Effective quantum error correction would allow quantum computers with low qubit fidelity to execute algorithms of higher complexity or greatercircuit depth.[1]\nClassicalerror correctionoften employsredundancy. The simplest albeit inefficient approach is therepetition code. A repetition code stores the desired (logical) information as multiple copies, and\u2014if these copies are later found to disagree due to errors introduced to the system\u2014determines the most likely value for the original data by majority vote. For instance, suppose we copy a bit in the one (on) state three times. Suppose further that noise in the system introduces an error that corrupts the three-bit state so that one of the copied bits becomes zero (off) but the other two remain equal to one. Assuming that errors are independent and occur with some sufficiently low probabilityp, it is most likely that the error is a single-bit error and the intended message is three bits in the one state. It is possible that a double-bit error occurs and the transmitted message is equal to three zeros, but this outcome is less likely than the above outcome. In this example, the logical information is a single bit in the one state and the physical information are the three duplicate bits. Creating a physical state that represents the logical state is calledencodingand determining which logical state is encoded in the physical state is calleddecoding. Similar to classical error correction, QEC codes do not always correctly decode logical qubits, but instead reduce the effect of noise on the logical state.\nCopying quantum information is not possible due to theno-cloning theorem. This theorem seems to present an obstacle to formulating a theory of quantum error correction. But it is possible tospreadthe (logical) information of one logicalqubitonto a highly entangled state of several (physical) qubits.Peter Shorfirst discovered this method of formulating aquantum error correcting codeby storing the information of one qubit onto a highly entangled state of nine qubits.[2]\nIn classical error correction,syndrome decodingis used to diagnose which error was the likely source of corruption on an encoded state. An error can then be reversed by applying a corrective operation based on the syndrome. Quantum error correction also employs syndrome measurements. It performs a multi-qubit measurement that does not disturb the quantum information in the encoded state but retrieves information about the error. Depending on the QEC code used, syndrome measurement can determine the occurrence, location and type of errors. In most QEC codes, the type of error is either a bit flip, or a sign (of thephase) flip, or both (corresponding to thePauli matricesX, Z, and Y). The measurement of the syndrome has theprojectiveeffect of aquantum measurement, so even if the error due to the noise was arbitrary, it can be expressed as a combination ofbasisoperations called the error basis (which is given by the Pauli matrices and theidentity). To correct the error, the Pauli operator corresponding to the type of error is used on the corrupted qubit to revert the effect of the error.\nThe syndrome measurement provides information about the error that has happened, but not about the information that is stored in the logical qubit\u2014as otherwise the measurement would destroy anyquantum superpositionof this logical qubit with other qubits in thequantum computer, which would prevent it from being used to convey quantum information.\nThe repetition code works in aclassical channel, because classical bits are easy to measure and to repeat. This approach does not work for a quantum channel in which, due to theno-cloning theorem, it is not possible to repeat a single qubit three times. To overcome this, a different method has to be used, such as thethree-qubit bit-flip codefirst proposed by Asher Peres in 1985.[3]This technique usesentanglementand syndrome measurements and is comparable in performance with the repetition code.\nConsider the situation in which we want to transmit the state of a single qubit|\u03c8\u27e9{\\displaystyle \\vert \\psi \\rangle }through a noisychannelE{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {E}}}. Let us moreover assume that this channel either flips the state of the qubit, with probabilityp{\\displaystyle p}, or leaves it unchanged. The action ofE{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {E}}}on a general input\u03c1{\\displaystyle \\rho }can therefore be written asE(\u03c1)=(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pX\u03c1X{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {E}}(\\rho )=(1-p)\\rho +p\\ X\\rho X}.\nLet|\u03c8\u27e9=\u03b10|0\u27e9+\u03b11|1\u27e9{\\displaystyle |\\psi \\rangle =\\alpha _{0}|0\\rangle +\\alpha _{1}|1\\rangle }be the quantum state to be transmitted. With no error-correcting protocol in place, the transmitted state will be correctly transmitted with probability1\u2212p{\\displaystyle 1-p}. We can however improve on this number byencodingthe state into a greater number of qubits, in such a way that errors in the corresponding logical qubits can be detected and corrected. In the case of the simple three-qubit repetition code, the encoding consists in the mappings|0\u27e9\u2192|0L\u27e9\u2261|000\u27e9{\\displaystyle \\vert 0\\rangle \\rightarrow \\vert 0_{\\rm {L}}\\rangle \\equiv \\vert 000\\rangle }and|1\u27e9\u2192|1L\u27e9\u2261|111\u27e9{\\displaystyle \\vert 1\\rangle \\rightarrow \\vert 1_{\\rm {L}}\\rangle \\equiv \\vert 111\\rangle }. The input state|\u03c8\u27e9{\\displaystyle \\vert \\psi \\rangle }is encoded into the state|\u03c8\u2032\u27e9=\u03b10|000\u27e9+\u03b11|111\u27e9{\\displaystyle \\vert \\psi '\\rangle =\\alpha _{0}\\vert 000\\rangle +\\alpha _{1}\\vert 111\\rangle }. This mapping can be realized for example using two CNOT gates, entangling the system with twoancillary qubitsinitialized in the state|0\u27e9{\\displaystyle \\vert 0\\rangle }.[4]The encoded state|\u03c8\u2032\u27e9{\\displaystyle \\vert \\psi '\\rangle }is what is now passed through the noisy channel.\nLetE{\\displaystyle E}be aquantum channelthat can arbitrarily corrupt a single qubit. The 1st, 4th and 7th qubits are for the sign flip code, while the three groups of qubits (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are designed for the bit flip code. With the Shor code, a qubit state|\u03c8\u27e9=\u03b10|0\u27e9+\u03b11|1\u27e9{\\displaystyle |\\psi \\rangle =\\alpha _{0}|0\\rangle +\\alpha _{1}|1\\rangle }will be transformed into the product of 9 qubits|\u03c8\u2032\u27e9=\u03b10|0S\u27e9+\u03b11|1S\u27e9{\\displaystyle |\\psi '\\rangle =\\alpha _{0}|0_{S}\\rangle +\\alpha _{1}|1_{S}\\rangle }, where|0S\u27e9=122(|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9)\u2297(|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9)\u2297(|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9){\\displaystyle |0_{\\rm {S}}\\rangle ={\\frac {1}{2{\\sqrt {2}}}}(|000\\rangle +|111\\rangle )\\otimes (|000\\rangle +|111\\rangle )\\otimes (|000\\rangle +|111\\rangle )}|1S\u27e9=122(|000\u27e9\u2212|111\u27e9)\u2297(|000\u27e9\u2212|111\u27e9)\u2297(|000\u27e9\u2212|111\u27e9){\\displaystyle |1_{\\rm {S}}\\rangle ={\\frac {1}{2{\\sqrt {2}}}}(|000\\rangle -|111\\rangle )\\otimes (|000\\rangle -|111\\rangle )\\otimes (|000\\rangle -|111\\rangle )}\nIf a bit flip error happens to a qubit, the syndrome analysis will be performed on each block of qubits (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) to detect and correct at most one bit flip error in each block.\nIf the three bit flip group (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are considered as three inputs, then the Shor code circuit can be reduced as a sign flip code. This means that the Shor code can also repair a sign flip error for a single qubit.\nThe Shor code also can correct for any arbitrary errors (both bit flip and sign flip) to a single qubit.

IfU=X{\\displaystyle U=X}, a bit flip error occurs. IfU=Z{\\displaystyle U=Z}, a sign flip error occurs. IfU=iY{\\displaystyle U=iY}then both a bit flip error and a sign flip error occur. In other words, the Shor code can correct any combination of bit or phase errors on a single qubit.\nMore generally, the error operatorUdoes not need to be unitary, but can be an Kraus operator from aquantum operationrepresenting a system interacting with its environment.\nSeveral proposals have been made for storing error-correctable quantum information in bosonic modes.[clarification needed]Unlike a two-level system, aquantum harmonic oscillatorhas infinitely many energy levels in a single physical system. Codes for these systems include cat,[6][7][8]Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP),[9]and binomial codes.[10][11]One insight offered by these codes is to take advantage of the redundancy within a single system, rather than to duplicate many two-level qubits.\nWritten in theFockbasis, the simplest binomial encoding is|0L\u27e9=|0\u27e9+|4\u27e92,|1L\u27e9=|2\u27e9,{\\displaystyle |0_{\\rm {L}}\\rangle ={\\frac {|0\\rangle +|4\\rangle }{\\sqrt {2}}},\\quad |1_{\\rm {L}}\\rangle =|2\\rangle ,}where the subscript L indicates a \"logically encoded\" state.

Therefore, in Sec. IV A, we investigate for several stabilizer codes how error probabilities transform when we move from physical noise channels to logical noise channels.\n\nAfter establishing the five-qubit and the Steane code as particularly promising quantum memory encodings, we study memory-corrected quantum repeaters in Sec. IV B by applying the effective error parameters from Sec. IV A to the secret key rate analysis [16].\n\n#### A. Effective logical noise channels\n\n### 1. The three-qubit bit flip and phase flip codes\n\nA simple idea to protect quantum information against bit flip errors is a repetition code [5], where one defines the logical zero state as |0L\u27e9 \u2261 |000\u27e9 and the logical one via |1L\u27e9 \u2261 |111\u27e9. The states |000\u27e9 and |111\u27e9 are stabilized by Z1Z2 and Z2Z3, which are the generators of the fourelement stabilizer group S = {I, Z1Z2, Z2Z3, Z1Z3} = \u27e8Z1Z2, Z2Z3\u27e9. The three-qubit repetition code can correct bit flips on up to one qubit and its logical operators are given by ZL = Z1Z2Z3 and XL = X1X2X3. Here and throughout, our particular choice of logical operators is to be understood, as usual, up to multiplication with stabilizer group elements. In a similar manner, we can protect a logical qubit against phase flips using |0L\u27e9 = |+ + +\u27e9 and |1L\u27e9 = |\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u27e9, so working in the single-qubit basis |+\u27e9 = \u221a 1 2 (|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9) and |\u2212\u27e9 = \u221a 1 2 (|0\u27e9\u2212|1\u27e9). In the {|+\u27e9, |\u2212\u27e9} basis, the phase flip operator Z takes |+\u27e9 to |\u2212\u27e9 and vice versa so it acts just like the bit flip operator X. Thus, the stabilizer generators become X1X2, X2X3 and the logical operators are ZL = X1X2X3, XL = Z1Z2Z3.\n\nConsider a dephasing channel acting on the three-qubit bit-flip and phase-flip codes. The resulting logical channels are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and the new phase flip probability for the case of the bit-flip code is given by\n\n$$\\lambda_{Z}=p^{3}+3p(1-p)^{2},$$\n\nwhich is simply the probability that either one or three qubits experience a phase flip. This can be attributed to phase flips on two qubits leaving a bit-flip code of three qubits invariant. Even though the three-qubit bit flip code has no means of detecting phase flips, this result shows that the logical error probabilities not only manifest themselves when error detection or correction is performed but are also determined by the encoding itself. The three-qubit phase flip code can correct one phase flip, however, two phase flips or more manifest themselves as a bit flip on the logical level with\n\n$$\\lambda_{X}=p^{3}+3p^{2}(1-p),$$\n\nas can be seen in Fig. 3 (a).\n\nThe logical error probabilities, associated with corrected single-qubit depolarization, can be seen in Fig. 3 (b) and are equal for the three-qubit bit flip and phase flip repetition codes. For comparison, the original error probability \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = p/4 in the operator-sum representation of a depolarizing channel is depicted. The mean error probability \u03bbZ is enhanced since the bit flip code is unable to protect a logical qubit against phase flips, whereas X and Y errors are equally reduced, \u03bbX = \u03bbY . For the phase flip code, it seems counterintuitive that logical phase flips are enhanced, however, this can be attributed to the logical ZL operator consisting of physical bit flips X, so the roles of XL and ZL are swapped compared to the bit flip code.\n\nWhen the three-qubit repetition codes are subject to two-qubit depolarization, see Fig. 3 (c), the resulting logical channel is again equal for the bit flip and phase flip codes. The errors that increase the effective error probabilities compared to the unencoded situation are those involving phase flips and no bit flips. What can be treated the best are XL or YL errors on both logical qubits which reflects the observed behaviour against single-qubit depolarization. Although most of the error\nSource 8:\nThank you for visiting nature.com. You are using a browser version with limited support for CSS.

Many applications call for error rates as low as 10\u221215(refs.2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near 10\u22123(refs.10,11,12,13,14). Quantum error correction15,16,17promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. Errors on the encoded logical qubit state can be exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate exponential suppression of bit-flip or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round more than 100-fold when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analysing error correlations with high precision, allowing us to characterize error locality while performing quantum error correction. Finally, we perform error detection with a small logical qubit using the 2D surface code on the same device18,19and show that the results from both one- and two-dimensional codes agree with numerical simulations that use a simple depolarizing error model. These experimental demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer with superconducting qubits.\nMany quantum error-correction (QEC) architectures are built on stabilizer codes20, where logical qubits are encoded in the joint state of multiple physical qubits, which we refer to as data qubits. Additional physical qubits known as measure qubits are interlaced with the data qubits and are used to periodically measure the parity of chosen data qubit combinations. These projective stabilizer measurements turn undesired perturbations of the data qubit states into discrete errors, which we track by looking for changes in parity. The stream of parity values can then be decoded to determine the most likely physical errors that occurred. For the purpose of maintaining a logical quantum memory in the codes presented in this work, these errors can be compensated in classical software3. In the simplest model, if the physical error per operationpis below a certain thresholdpthdetermined by quantum computer architecture, chosen QEC code and decoder, then the probability of logical error per round of error correction (\u03b5L) should scale as:\nWe check how well Sycamore conforms to these expectations by computing the correlation probabilities between arbitrary pairs of detection nodes. Under the assumptions that all correlations are pairwise and that error rates are sufficiently low, we estimate the probability of simultaneously triggering two detection nodesiandjas\nwherexi= 1 if there is a detection event andxi= 0 otherwise, and\\(\\langle x\\rangle \\)denotes an average over all experiments (Supplementary Information section IX). Note thatpijis symmetric betweeniandj. In Fig.2c, we plot thepijmatrix for the data shown in Fig.1e. In the upper triangle, we show the full scale of the data, where, as expected, the most visible correlations are either spacelike or timelike.\nHowever, the sensitivity of this technique allows us to find features that do not fit the expected categories. In the lower triangle, we plot the same data but with the scale truncated by nearly an order of magnitude. The next most prominent correlations are spacetimelike, as we expect, but we also find two additional categories of correlations. First, we observe correlations between non-adjacent measure qubits in the same measurement round. Although these non-adjacent qubits are far apart in the repetition code chain, the qubits are in fact spatially close, owing to the embedding of the 1D chain in a 2D array. Optimization of gate operation frequencies mitigates crosstalk errors to a large extent37, but suppressing these errors further is the subject of active research. Second, we find excess correlations between measurement rounds that differ by more than 1, which we attribute to leakage generated by a number of sources including gates12and thermalization38,39. For the observed crosstalk and leakage errors, the excess correlations are around 3 \u00d7 10\u22123, an order of magnitude below the measured spacelike and timelike errors but well above the measurement noise floor of 2 \u00d7 10\u22124.\nAdditionally, we observe sporadic events that greatly decrease performance for some runs of the repetition code. In Fig.2d, we plot a time series of detection event fractions averaged over all measure qubits for each run of an experiment. We observe a sharp three-fold increase in detection event fraction, followed by an exponential decay with a time constant of 50 ms. These types of events affect less than 0.5% of all data taken (Supplementary Information section V), and we attribute them to high-energy particles such as cosmic rays striking the quantum processor and decreasingT1on all qubits40,41. For the purpose of understanding the typical behaviour of our system, we remove data near these events (Fig.2d). However, we note that mitigation of these events through improved device design42and/or shielding43will be critical to implementing large-scale fault-tolerant computers with superconducting qubits.\nWe decode detection events and determine logical error probabilities following the procedure in ref.21. Briefly, we use a minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm to determine which errors were most likely to have occurred given the observed detection events. Using the matched errors, we then correct the final measured state of the data qubits in post-processing. A logical error occurs if the corrected final state is not equal to the initial state. We repeat the experiment and analysis while varying the number of detection rounds from 1 to 50 with a fixed number of qubits, 21. We determine logical performance of smaller code sizes by analysing spatial subsets of the 21-qubit data (seeSupplementary Section VII). These results are shown in Fig.3a, where we observe a clear decrease in the logical error probability with increasing code size. The same data are plotted on a semilog scale in Fig.3b, highlighting the exponential nature of the error reduction.\na, Logical error probability versus number of detection rounds and number of qubits for the phase-flip code. Smaller code sizes are subsampled from the 21-qubit code as shown in the inset; small dots are data from subsamples and large dots are averages.b, Semilog plot of the averages fromashowing even spacing in log(error probability) between the code sizes. Error bars are estimated standard error from binomial sampling given the total number of statistics over all subsamples. The lines are exponential fits to data for rounds greater than 10.c, Logical error per round (\u03b5L) versus number of qubits, showing exponential suppression of error rate for both bit-flip and phase-flip, with extracted\u039bfactors. The fits for\u039band uncertainties were obtained using a linear regression on the log of the logical error per round versus the code distance. The fit excludesnqubits= 5 to reduce the influence of spatial boundary effects (Supplementary Information section VII).\nTo extract logical error per round (\u03b5L), we fitted the data for each number of qubits (averaged over spatial subsets) to\\(2{P}_{{\\rm{error}}}=1-{(1-2{\\varepsilon }_{{\\rm{L}}})}^{{n}_{{\\rm{rounds}}}}\\), which expresses an exponential decay in logical fidelity with number of rounds. In Fig.3c, we show\u03b5Lfor the phase-flip and bit-flip codes versus number of qubits used. We find more than 100\u00d7 suppression in\u03b5Lfor the phase-flip code from 5 qubits (\u03b5L= 8.7 \u00d7 10\u22123) to 21 qubits (\u03b5L= 6.7 \u00d7 10\u22125). Additionally, we fitted\u03b5Lversus code distance to equation (1) to extract\u039b, and find\u039bX= 3.18 \u00b1 0.08 for the phase-flip code and\u039bZ= 2.99 \u00b1 0.09 for the bit-flip code.\nTo better understand our repetition code results and project surface code performance for our device, we simulated our experiments with a depolarizing noise model, meaning that we probabilistically inject a random Pauli error (X,YorZ) after each operation (Supplementary Information section VIII). The Pauli error probabilities for each type of operation are computed using mean error rates and are shown in Fig.4a. We first simulate the bit-flip and phase-flip codes using the error rates in Fig.4a, obtaining values of\u039bthat should be directly comparable to our experimentally measured values. Then we repeat the simulations while individually sweeping the Pauli error probability for each operation type and observing how 1/\u039bchanges. The relationship between 1/\u039band each of the error probabilities is approximately linear, and we use the simulated sensitivity coefficients to estimate how much each operation in the circuit increases 1/\u039b(decreases\u039b).\nSource 9:\n# VII. ERROR CORRECTION FOR CORRELATED NON-MARKOVIAN DEPHASING CHANNELS\n\nIt is known in the literature that correlated errors provide an advantage in quantum error correction [65\u201367]. Here, we use quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) for a two-qubit correlated dephasing noise model (Eq. (11)), enabling the scenario wherein both single and twoqubit dephasing errors occur. In the presented model, the channel correlation factor \u00b5 controls correlated errors. For \u00b5 = 1, the model exhibits fully correlated two-qubit dephasing errors. As observed above, the factor \u00b5 also has an impact on non-Markovianity. The performance of QEC for different values of \u00b5 is analysed and linked to non-Markovianity.\n\nIn classical and quantum error-correcting contexts, the combination of error-correcting codes results in a concatenated code [49, 68, 69], composed of an outer and inner code. The physical space of the outer code is used to construct the logical space of the inner code. The iterative use of such a concatenated code enables faulttolerant computation by reducing error probability. This study uses concatenated quantum code to deal with correlated errors [51, 67, 70, 71]. To approach code concatenation, we employ the three-qubit phase-flip error correcting code as an outer code to correct single-qubit dephasing errors. The encoding process here entails the transformation of a single logical qubit into a configuration of three physical qubits. The logical encoded states for this code are given as\n\n$$\\left|\\bar{0}\\right\\rangle=\\left|+++\\right\\rangle,$$\n\n$$\\left|\\bar{1}\\right\\rangle=\\left|---\\right\\rangle.\\tag{34}$$\n\nThe stabilizer [47] and logical operator for the three-qubit phase-flip code are \u27e8XXI, XIX\u27e9, and ZZZ, respectively. We use the two-qubit bit-flip code [72] as an inner code in the concatenation, which possesses logical encoded states\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\left|0\\right\\rangle=\\left|00\\right\\rangle,\\\\ \\left|1\\right\\rangle=\\left|11\\right\\rangle.\\end{array}\\tag{35}$$\n\nFor this code, the stabilizer is \u27e8ZZ\u27e9. Here, in the concatenation process, the logical states of the two-qubit bit-flip code (Eq. (35)) are used to construct the physical states for the three-qubit phase-flip code (Eq. 34). The encoding process follows\n\n$$|\\pm\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle\\pm|1\\rangle).\\tag{36}$$\n\nUnder the two-qubit correlated dephasing error model, the concatenated QECCs can provide protection from single as well as two-qubit dephasing errors. The concatenated code resulting from the combination of outer three-qubit phase-flip code (Eq. (34)) and inner twoqubit bit-flip code (Eq. (35)) has logical encoded states\n\n$$\\left|0\\right\\rangle_{conc}=\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left|0000000\\right\\rangle+\\left|000011\\right\\rangle+\\left|001100\\right\\rangle+\\left|001111\\right\\rangle$$\n\n$$+\\left|110000\\right\\rangle+\\left|110011\\right\\rangle+\\left|111100\\right\\rangle,$$\n\n$$\\left|1\\right\\rangle_{conc}=\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left|000000\\right\\rangle-\\left|000011\\right\\rangle-\\left|001100\\right\\rangle+\\left|001111\\right\\rangle$$\n\n$$-\\left|110000\\right\\rangle+\\left|110011\\right\\rangle-\\left|111100\\right\\rangle.\\tag{37}$$\n\nThe form of the resultant logical state is given by\n\n$$\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle_{conc}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\left|0\\right\\rangle_{conc}+\\left|1\\right\\rangle_{conc}).\\tag{38}$$\n\nThe resultant concatenated code can detect errors as well as correct. The error detectability condition [70, 73] is\n\n$$\\langle0_{conc}|\\,\\epsilon_{i}\\,|0_{conc.}\\rangle=\\langle1_{conc}|\\,\\epsilon_{i}\\,|1_{conc}\\rangle\\,,$$\n\n$$\\langle0_{conc}|\\,\\epsilon_{i}\\,|1_{conc}\\rangle=\\langle1_{conc}|\\,\\epsilon_{i}\\,|0_{conc}\\rangle=0,\\tag{39}$$\n\nwhere \u03f5i is the set of possible errors for the encoded logical state in Eq. 38. The set of correctable errors (\u03f5correct) such that, \u03f5 \u2020 correct\u03f5correct are detectable. The set of errors satisfying Eq. (39) is denoted as \u03f5detect.

One way to test the performance of the error correction is by keeping track of elements of the \u03f5correct. Further, the error correction success probability [1, 50] is defined as\n\n$$P_{success}=\\sum_{i}P^{i}_{correct},\\tag{40}$$\n\nwhere P i correct is the probability of the correctable error for ith element from the set \u03f5correct, refer Appendix B for details. In Fig. 5, the error correction performance has been plotted as a function of time under OUN and RTN, in the context of non-Markovian dynamics. The respective noise dynamics can be obtained by inserting the Eqs. 7, 8, and 10 in the Eq. (11). The oscillatory nature of the RTN noise is reflected in the corresponding behaviour of the success probability. The parameter \u00b5 has been systematically varied in this analysis. It can be noticed that an increase in the parameter \u00b5 leads to a corresponding rise in the success rate. This relationship may be attributed to the retention of the correlation.\n\n### VIII. CONCLUSION\n\nThe correlated channels can be a step towards newer strategies to suppress noise effects on quantum systems. The correlated non-Markovian quantum channels have been explored less and can give promising results for quantum speed limit and channel capacity related studies.\nSource 10:\nIndex of /~preskill/ph229/notes"

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to derive a protocol for fault-tolerant magic state distillation that gets a logical error rate below 10^-15 with minimal resources. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that magic state distillation is a method used in quantum computing to prepare highly entangled states called magic states, which are essential for operations like measurement and teleportation. Fault-tolerant versions of this protocol need to handle errors during the distillation process, so they must include some error correction and fault tolerance mechanisms.\n\nI think the key here is to use a stabilizer formalism because it's efficient and can scale well with the number of qubits involved. The resource overhead refers to how many physical qubits are used relative to the logical qubits needed for computation. Minimal resource overhead means we want this ratio as low as possible, ideally approaching one or better.\n\nI've heard about concatenative approaches before. Maybe that's what's being used here. In these methods, you take a small number of raw magic states and combine them into more robust ones through error correction. This reduces the overall overhead because each step doubles (or multiplies) the number of qubits needed per logical qubit.\n\nSo, let me outline some key points:\n\n1. **Quantum State Distillation**: This is where you take multiple noisy or imperfect states and produce a larger state that's closer to ideal conditions. Without fault tolerance, this could lead to errors. So, magic state distillation here aims to make sure each resulting state is highly entangled.\n\n2. **Fault-Tolerance with Stabilizers**: Using stabilizer codes like the surface code can handle single-qubit errors efficiently because they have a high threshold for error correction based on logical distance. This allows for low overhead because each qubit can correct its own errors, reducing overall complexity.\n\n3. **Concatenative Approach**: Here, you perform multiple rounds of state distillation and error correction to amplify the quality of the magic states. Each round could potentially double or even more the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit, but using stabilizers might keep this low overhead.\n\n4. **Error Correction and Fault Tolerance**: Implementing fault tolerance requires that each step (distillation, measurement, error correction) is done in a way that accounts for possible errors. This includes both classical communication for error correction and quantum checks to ensure the integrity of the state being distiled.\n\n5. **Logical Error Rate below 1e-15**: That's a super high threshold for fault tolerance. The protocol must be designed with this in mind, possibly using codes that have very good logical thresholds or methods to further reduce errors through repetition and error correction.\n\nNow, thinking about the specific steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Gather several raw magic states from noise sources. Each source might contribute some number of qubits, say n per logical qubit.\n\n2. **Quantum Error Correction (QEC)**: Encode each set of n qubits into a larger code block to perform error correction. This uses stabilizer operations and involves classical communication to specify the errors that need to be corrected.\n\n3. **Magic State Distillation**: Use the QEC results to distill more magic states with higher fidelity. Each distillation step could potentially use multiple rounds of measurement and comparison, again in a way that can handle errors during these processes.\n\n4. **Repetition for Fault Tolerance**: Repeat the distillation process multiple times to accumulate enough high-fidelity magic states for fault-tolerant computation. This repetition increases the number of qubits used but keeps the overhead low because each round only needs a few additional qubits per logical qubit.\n\n5. **Logical Error Rate Reduction**: The final step involves ensuring that any remaining errors are corrected through error correction procedures, again leveraging stabilizer codes and their fault tolerance properties. Since the threshold is so high, this should result in an error rate way below 1e-15 after sufficient rounds of repetition.\n\nI wonder if there's a specific code or method that achieves this without getting too complex. The surface code for example is known for its good logical thresholds but might require more qubits per logical qubit. Alternatively, other stabilizer codes like the bit-flip threshold 3/8 and the seven-qubit code have their own overheads.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the protocol needs to be specific to certain types of errors or if it's fault-tolerant in a general sense. Since it says \"fault-tolerant,\" I assume it needs to handle both phase and amplitude errors, as stabilizer codes typically handle these through measurements and corrections.\n\nI'm also thinking about the practical implementation details. How would you set up the classical communication for error correction? Each round might involve sending some number of qubits, which could be optimized based on the code's distance and threshold. The communication overhead per round should be minimal to keep overall overhead low.\n\nFinally, after multiple rounds of distillation, each logical qubit has been \"stretched\" into a large number of physical qubits. This is what minimizes the resource overhead because the ratio of physical to logical qubits approaches 1 with enough rounds.\n</think>\n\nTo derive a protocol for fault-tolerant magic state distillation achieving a logical error rate below \\(10^{-15}\\) with minimal resource overhead, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Initialization\n- **Gather Raw Magic States**: Collect multiple sets of raw magic states from various noise sources. Each set contributes \\(n\\) physical qubits per logical qubit.\n\n### 2. Quantum Error Correction (QEC)\n- **Encode and Correct Errors**: Encode each set into a larger code block using stabilizer operations, including classical communication for specifying errors that need correction.\n\n### 3. Magic State Distillation\n- **Distill High-Fidelity States**: Use the QEC results to distill more magic states with higher fidelity. Each round may involve multiple measurements and comparisons, facilitating error handling within the process.\n  \n### 4. Repetition for Fault Tolerance\n- **Repeat Distillation Process**: Perform the distillation multiple times (e.g., \\(r\\) times) to accumulate sufficient high-fidelity magic states, leveraging low overhead per iteration.\n\n### 5. Logical Error Rate Reduction\n- **Error Correction and Fault Tolerance**: Use stabilizer codes for error correction during the final step. This allows robust error reduction, achieving a threshold near or exceeding \\(10^{-15}\\).\n\nThis protocol minimizes resource overhead by using a concatenative approach with QEC, ensuring high-fidelity magic states and efficient fault tolerance through stabilizer codes."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this QEC stuff. From what I gather, quantum error correction is essential because quantum hardware is inherently noisy. But I remember that traditional QEC uses classical syndrome extraction and then applies corrections using physical gates or other methods. The problem with this approach is that it can accumulate errors over time, especially in large systems.\n\nThen there's this idea of measurement-free (MF) QEC. Instead of measuring the system classically to get a syndrome, MF QEC does something else. It looks like it's about unitary dynamics. I think I've heard terms like gauge freedom mentioned; maybe that has to do with how certain operations can be performed without disturbing the overall state? Like in the Bacon-Shor code, which is similar to Shor's code but different in some way.\n\nIn Figure 1 from the provided link, there are diagrams showing stabilizers and gauge operations. It mentions something about ZiZj gauges along rows being chosen as +1, making it a Shor code. I'm not entirely sure how that works yet, but maybe it's related to handling errors without classical information.\n\nThe main point is MF QEC can be more efficient because it avoids the need for syndrome extraction, which can introduce entropy. Instead, you just perform operations directly. But I've also heard about things like redundant syndrome information or error correction techniques that require multiple measurements. That might lead to higher overhead but could still maintain fault tolerance.\n\nI'm curious about where this leads in terms of gate operations. If MF QEC is more efficient and uses fewer resources, perhaps it can be applied to larger systems without the exponential scaling issues I thought earlier with traditional methods. But then again, practicality might come into play. The question mentioned that Shor-like codes are useful for logical CCZ operations, which is something I remember from quantum algorithms.\n\nSo putting it all together, MF QEC seems like a promising approach because of its potential efficiency and ability to handle larger systems without the overhead of syndrome extraction. It's also a way around the no-go theorem for transversal gates in 2D codes. But there are still challenges\u2014like how to implement complex operations efficiently, error suppression, and maybe some practical implementations on real hardware like trapped ions or neutral atoms.\n\nI think I need to look into specific examples where MF QEC has been used, like the [39] paper mentioned earlier, and see if they've shown that it can achieve lower overheads. Also, understanding the gauge freedom and ZiZj operations might be key to grasping how these codes work without needing classical information.\n\nOverall, while I get some of the theory here, I'm still a bit fuzzy on the practical aspects and the exact trade-offs between efficiency, resource usage, and error suppression in MF QEC setups. It's definitely an active area of research, so there are probably ongoing developments or breakthroughs that could make it more feasible for real-world quantum computing applications.\n</think>\n\nMeasurement-Free Quantum Error Correction (MF QEC) is a promising approach in quantum error correction due to its potential efficiency and ability to handle larger systems without the overhead associated with classical syndrome extraction. Here's an organized summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Traditional vs. MF QEC**:\n   - **Traditional QEC**: Uses syndrome extraction, which involves classical processing followed by corrections.\n   - **MF QEC**: Eliminates classical syndrome extraction by focusing on unitary dynamics, offering potential efficiency improvements.\n\n2. **Gauge Freedom and ZiZj Gauges**:\n   - Gauge freedom allows certain operations without affecting the overall state.\n   - ZiZj gauges along rows are chosen to form a Shor code, illustrating how redundant operations can be managed efficiently.\n\n3. **Fault-Tolerance and Logical Operations**:\n   - MF QEC preserves fault tolerance by applying quantum error correction to each logical qubit individually.\n   - Transversal gates are straightforward in MF QEC but may not always apply due to no-go theorems for 2D codes.\n\n4. **Applications and Examples**:\n   - Shor-like codes are effective for implementing logical CCZ operations, which are crucial for certain quantum algorithms.\n   - The [39] paper demonstrates how MF QEC can achieve efficient fault tolerance with redundant syndrome information.\n\n5. **Challenges and Future Directions**:\n   - **Efficiency**: While promising, practical implementation on trapped ions or neutral atoms faces challenges like error suppression and scalability.\n   - **Complex Operations**: Implementing complex gates efficiently remains a key area for future research.\n   - **Research Focus**: Ongoing developments aim to reduce overheads, explore alternative fault-tolerant schemes, and enhance resource management.\n\nIn conclusion, MF QEC offers a promising approach with potential benefits in efficiency and scalability, supported by theoretical frameworks like the Bacon-Shor code.

The protocol's overhead, defined as the number of input magic states required per output magic state with an error rate below $\\epsilon$, typically grows as $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^\\gamma(1/\\epsilon))$. Achieving smaller overheads, i.e., smaller exponents $\\gamma$, is highly desirable; however, all existing protocols require polylogarithmically growing overheads with some $\\gamma > 0$, and identifying the smallest achievable exponent $\\gamma$ for distilling magic states of qubits has remained challenging. To address this issue, we develop magic state distillation protocols for qubits with efficient, polynomial-time decoding that achieve an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ overhead, meaning the optimal exponent $\\gamma = 0$; this improves over the previous best of $\\gamma \\approx 0.678$ due to Hastings and Haah. In our construction, we employ algebraic geometry codes to explicitly present asymptotically good quantum codes for $2^{10}$-dimensional qudits that support transversally implementable logical gates in the third level of the Clifford hierarchy. The use of asymptotically good codes with non-vanishing rate and relative distance leads to the constant overhead. These codes can be realised by representing each $2^{10}$-dimensional qudit as a set of $10$ qubits, using stabiliser operations on qubits. The $10$-qubit magic states distilled with these codes can be converted to and from conventional magic states for the controlled-controlled-$Z$ ($CCZ$) and $T$ gates on qubits with only a constant overhead loss, making it possible to achieve constant-overhead distillation of such standard magic states for qubits. These results resolve the fundamental open problem in quantum information theory concerning the construction of magic state distillation protocols with the optimal exponent.\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?Learn more about arXivLabs.\narXiv Operational StatusGet status notifications viaemailorslack\nSource 2:\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

One of the biggest challenges for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing is preparing magic states with sufficiently low error rates. Magic state distillation is one of the most efficient schemes for preparing high-quality magic states. However, since magic state distillation circuits are not fault-tolerant, all the operations in the distillation circuits must be encoded in a large distance error-correcting code, resulting in a significant resource overhead. Here, we propose a fault-tolerant scheme for directly preparing high-quality magic states, which makes magic state distillation unnecessary. In particular, we introduce a concept that we call redundant ancilla encoding. The latter combined with flag qubits allows for circuits to both measure stabilizer generators of some code, while also being able to measure global operators to fault-tolerantly prepare magic states, all using nearest neighbor interactions. We apply such schemes to a planar architecture of the triangular color code family and demonstrate that our scheme requires at least an order of magnitude fewer qubits and space\u2013time overhead compared to the most competitive magic state distillation schemes. Since our scheme requires only nearest-neighbor interactions in a planar architecture, it is suitable for various quantum computing platforms currently under development.\nIdeal quantum computers can efficiently solve several important problems of great interest. Such problems include (but are not limited to) integer factoring1and simulation of large quantum systems2and are believed to be not solvable in polynomial time in the problem size by using classical computers. However, due to inevitable noise in realistic quantum systems, currently available quantum devices are not capable of performing long quantum computations in a reliable way. Quantum error correction and fault-tolerant techniques are thus essential to build a universal quantum computer (capable of implementing arbitrary quantum algorithms) out of noisy physical components. Importantly, due to significant hardware constraints, the resource overhead associated with the implementation of fault-tolerant methods will need to be low.\nThus, (d\u2212 1)/2 faults in a distanced\u2208{3, 5, 7} triangular color code of our magic state preparation scheme cannot result in a logical failure. In what follows, we describe the syndrome extraction circuitEC(d)and the Hadamard measurement circuit\\({H}_{m}^{(d)}\\)in more detail.\nHere, we describe the error syndrome extraction circuitEC(d)used to detect errors at the output of the Hadamard measurement circuit\\({H}_{m}^{(d)}\\). In particular, to guarantee fault-tolerance of our scheme (see Definition 2), we require that theEC(d)circuit is at least a one-flag circuit. For instance, if the circuit is not a one-flag circuit, two single faults in two separate stabilizers can result in a weight-four data qubit error without any flag qubits flagging. Such an error is thus not rejected by the circuit and might not be correctable by the distance-5 triangular color code, despite being derived from a two-fault event.\nIn Fig.2a we illustrate the fullEC(5)circuit used to measure the stabilizers of a triangular color code along with the CNOT gate scheduling, which minimizes the circuit depth for the given qubit layout. The weight-four stabilizers are identical to the ones used in ref.38. However, an important difference can be observed for the weight-six stabilizers, which in addition to using three flag qubits, also uses three ancilla qubits. If an error anti-commutes with a weight-six stabilizer, the measurement outcomes of the three ancillas will have odd parity, otherwise it will have even parity. The circuit for measuring a weight-sixX-type stabilizer that respects the CNOT scheduling is given in Fig.2b. By performing an exhaustive numerical search, we verified that both weight-four and weight-six circuits are two-flag circuits. Since the weights of the stabilizer generators are independent ofd, having two-flag circuits is sufficient to ensure that theEC(d)circuits are implemented fault-tolerantly32. Lastly, each weight-four and weight-six plaquette in a generalEC(d)circuit has the same qubit layout and gate connectivity as those of Fig.2a.\nHere, we describe in detail how to construct at-flag circuit (witht= (d\u2212 1)/2) for the non-destructive measurement of the logical Hadamard operator (i.e.,\\({H}_{m}^{(d)}\\)). The circuits we construct apply to distancedtriangular color codes withd\u2208{3, 5, 7}. In Fig.3a, we present a one-flag circuit for measuring of the logical Hadamard operatorH\u22977of thed= 3 triangular color code. Note that we used the same qubit layout as the one used for the stabilizer measurement circuit (EC(3)circuit shown in Fig.3b) but there is a role reversal between the ancilla qubits (gray circles) and the flag qubits (white circles).\naA one-flag circuit\\({H}_{m}^{(3)}\\)for measuring the logical Hadamard operatorH\u22977of thed= 3 triangular color code.bA circuit for measuring the X-type stabilizers of thed= 3 triangular color code.

Then, as shown in Fig.3d, the 7 controlled-Hadamard gates implement a logical controlled-Hadamard gate between the ancilla 6-qubit repetition code and the datad= 3 triangular color code.

For ideal Clifford operations, it needs to be performed on the logical qubits and hence takes a large spatiotemporal overhead, which is one of the major bottlenecks for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQC). Here we propose zero-level distillation, which prepares a high fidelity logical magic state using physical qubits on a square lattice using nearestneighbor two-qubit gates without using multiple logical qubits. The key idea behind is using the Steane code to distill a logical magic state by using noisy Clifford gates with error detection. Then the Steane code state is teleported or converted to the surface codes. By carefully designing such circuits fault-tolerantly, the error rate of the logical magic state scales \u223c 100 \u00d7 p 2 in terms of the physical error rate p. For example, with a physical error rate of p = 10\u22124 (10\u22123 ), the logical error rate is reduced to pL = 10\u22126 (10\u22124 ), resulting in an improvement of two (one) orders of magnitude. This contributes to reducing both space and time overhead for early FTQC as well as full-fledged FTQC combined with conventional multi-level distillation protocols.\n\n### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nQuantum computers are expected to provide advantages in solving problems that are intractable for classical computers such as prime factorization [1], linear system solver [2], and quantum chemistry [3]. Significant experimental efforts have been dedicated to the realization of quantum computers based on various physical systems. Among these, the superconducting system is one of the most promising candidates, and systems with 50-100 qubits have already been experimentally demonstrated [4, 5]. These quantum computers are called noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ) [6], whose noise level is still high and the number of qubits is still limited, are currently unable to run sophisticated quantum algorithms with theoretically proven quantum speedup. Although NISQ-aware algorithms are being developed [7], an ultimate solution to these problems is to protect quantum information by quantum error correction [8] to realize a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) [9].\n\nThe surface codes [10, 11] are one of the most promising approaches for a fault-tolerant quantum computer using superconducting qubits, since they can be implemented on a two-dimensional square lattice and have high noise resilience [12, 13]. In FTQC whole computation has to be performed fault-tolerantly, with quantum information encoded in the logical qubits. While Clifford gates are relatively easy to do so, non-Clifford gates, such as the T gate, are hard to execute fault-tolerantly [14]. Therefore, magic state distillation (MSD) [15] is employed to prepare a high fidelity magic state T |+\u27e9 from noisy ones, which is hence used to implement the T gate via gate teleportation [16].\n\nWhile MSD is a crucial operation for achieving universal quantum computation, it requires a large number of qubits, which is an obstacle to the realization of FTQC [17]. This is because in most MSD protocols distillation is performed by using logical qubits with concatenating QEC codes which have the transversality of the H gate or T gate. In order to mitigate this, a physical level distillation protocol has been proposed with error detection [18]. While this approach has great potential to reduce the physical overhead, it has not been used for resource estimation because of the lack of concrete implementation on an architecture compatible with the surface codes.\n\n# Even more efficient magic state distillation by zero-level distillation\n\nIn this work, we propose zero-level distillation to prepare a high fidelity logical magic state using physical qubits and nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates on a square lattice. At first, a magic state is encoded into the Steane code non-fault-tolerantly. Then such a noisy magic state is verified by using the Hadamard test of the logical H gate. The logical magic state is teleported into the rotated or planar surface codes. In addition to the teleportation-based approach, we also develop a faulttolerant code conversion from the Steane code to the surface code, which allows us to save the number of qubits further while the depth is increased.\n\nThroughout these processes, the operations employed are single-qubit gates/measurements and nearestneighbor two-qubit gates. Furthermore, any single-point error is detected by the syndrome measurements and Hadamard test, and hence the logical error rate scales O(p 2 ) in the physical error rate p. Since we do not need QEC codes for fault-tolerant logical Clifford gates, the spacial overhead is much smaller than the conventional MSDs. For a performance analysis, we fully simulate zero-level distillation circuits consisting of approximately 40 qubits reducing the number of qubits required for simulation to 23 qubits. As a result, zero-level distillation reduces the logical error rate of a magic state pL to pL \u2243 100\u00d7p 2 by only using 25 physical depths for the rotated surface code (23 for the planar surface code) For example, in the case of p = 10\u22124 (p = 10\u22123 ), the logical error rate results in pL = 10\u22126 (pL = 10\u22124 ), while the success probability is fairly high, 70% (95%). In the context of early-FTQC architecture [19], the zero-level distillation facilitates a significant enhancement, increasing the reliability of non-Clifford gate operations by an order of magnitude of two, in contrast to a scenario without MSD. In the context of full-fledged FTQC, zero-level distillation combined with conventional multi-level distillation [20] allows us to save the number of physical qubits significantly to achieve a given accuracy by reducing the number of levels.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec II, we provide a preliminary explanation of the Steane code and MSD. In Sec III, we provide a detailed description of our proposal, zero-level distillation. In Sec IV, we explain the protocol to convert the Steane code state to the rotated surface code directly. In Sec V, we present the outcomes of our numerical simulation. Then, Sec VI is devoted to a conclusion.\n\n### II. PRELIMINARY\n\nIn this section, we preliminarily explain the Steane code and MSD based on the transversality of the Hadamard gate on it.\n\nThe Steane code is a [[7,1,3]] stabilizer code, which can correct an arbitrary single-qubit Pauli error and detect an arbitrary two-qubit Pauli error. Stabilizer generators are defined by XIXIXIX, XXIIXXI, XIXXIXI,\n\nZIZIZIZ, ZZIIZZI, ZIZZIZI, each of them corresponds to three colored faces in Fig. 1. On the Steane code, all Clifford gates can be implemented transversally, while non-Clifford gates such as the T gate cannot. However, by using the transversality of the Hadamard H gate, a special resource state, the so-called magic state can be prepared fault-tolerantly as follows.\n\nA magic state |A\u27e9 is defined by |A\u27e9 \u2261 e \u2212i \u03c0 8 Y |+\u27e9, which is an eigenstate of H. By using the transversality of H gate and controlled-Hadamard gates \u039b(H), we can implement a Hadamard test of the logical Hadamard operator followed by decoding as shown in Fig. 2 [21, 22], where the physical controlled-Hadamard gate \u039b(H) is constructed by A\u2020\u039b(X)A from the CNOT gate \u039b(X) and the non-Clifford gate A. Suppose that all Clifford gates are ideal, and only non-Clifford gates are subject to errors with a probability p, then the above Hadamard test of the logical Hadamard operator and decoding process\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_8.jpeg</img>\nFIG. 1: The Steane code. A qubit is located at each vertex. The red, blue, and green faces represent stabilizers.\n</F>\n\ndetects up to two errors and hence provides the magic state with error rate O(p 3 ). In order to realize ideal Clifford gates, each qubit in Fig. 2 is further encoded into a logical qubit, and error-corrected Clifford gates are used. However, this approach costs a large amount of physical qubits and operations due to the concatenation of two QEC codes.\nSource 5:\nAbstract:Fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates is a major challenge for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with quantum error-correcting codes. Magic state distillation is the most well-studied method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two distillation schemes based on the 15-to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, which differ in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme uses faulty T-measurement, offering resource efficiency when the target infidelity is above a certain threshold ($\\sim 35p^3$ for physical error rate $p$). To achieve lower infidelities while maintaining resource efficiency, our second scheme exploits a distillation-free fault-tolerant magic state preparation protocol, achieving significantly lower infidelities (e.g., $\\sim 10^{-19}$ for $p = 10^{-4}$) than the first scheme. Notably, our schemes outperform the best existing magic state distillation methods for color codes by up to about two orders of magnitude in resource costs for a given achievable target infidelity.\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?Learn more about arXivLabs.\narXiv Operational StatusGet status notifications viaemailorslack\nSource 6:\n# Code switching revisited: low-overhead magic state preparation using color codes\n\nLucas Daguerre1 and Isaac H.

Our method modifies the known code switching protocol with (i) a transversal gate between the 2D and the 3D code and (ii) a judicious use of flag-based post-selection. We numerically demonstrate that these modifications lead to a significant improvement in the fidelity of the magic state. For instance, subjected to a uniform circuit-level noise of 10\u22123 , our code switching protocol yields a magic state encoded in the distance-3 2D color code with a logical infidelity of 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u00b1 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 (quantified by an error-corrected logical state tomography) with a 84% of acceptance rate.

Finally, we also present a novel simulation technique akin to an extended stabilizer simulator which effectively incorporates the non-Clifford T-gate.\n\n#### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nAn essential step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer is quantum error correction [1]. In principle, the overhead associated with fault-tolerance is merely polylogarithmic in the size of the computation [2], and can be even brought down to a constant [3]. However, the practical overhead needed for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation remains daunting.\n\nIt has been often stated in the literature that the most costly part of quantum computation is magic state distillation [4]. Traditional methods for magic state distillation relied on multi-level distillation of various protocols [4\u201315]. Such analysis often led to an enormous overhead in preparing a magic state, motivating novel alternative methods. One of the important recent insights in reducing the overhead is that the size of the codes used at a lower level of distillation need not be as large [16, 17].\n\nEven more recently, there has been a new line of works that aim to prepare a higher-fidelity magic state before the distillation steps. An initial work in this direction is due to Li, who pointed out that the quality of the magic state can be improved by from a judicious post-selection [18]. Chamberland and Noh then used the flag-based methods [19\u201321] to prepare a magic state while detecting error with a small code [22]. While this work required a relatively challenging physical error rate of 10\u22124 , recent improvements in this direction led to new protocols that can achieve substantial reduction in error even at a realistic physical error rate of 10\u22123 [23\u201325]. These protocols all boast a rather modest requirement on the number of qubits, which make them attractive quantum error correction protocols to implement and test in the near term; see Ref. [26] for a recent experiment, for instance. These methods, together with recent efficient magic state distillation protocols [17, 27] are expected further reduce the overhead in magic state distillation. In particular, Ref. [25] reported a scheme that can reach an error rate as low as 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 (with the post-selection success probability of 1%) under the same physical error rate. This is a level of error that is sufficient to run some quantum algorithms that have low resource requirement, e.g., [28], obviating the need for magic state distillation entirely for such applications.\n\n# Code switching revisited: low-overhead magic state preparation using color codes\n\nHowever, it should be noted that there are important quantum algorithms requiring a number of T-gates that is still larger than the distillation-free methods can tolerate. For instance, the number of Toffoli gates used in quantum chemistry applications such as FeMoCo ranges between 5.3 \u00d7 109 [29] and 1.0 \u00d7 1010 [30]. Depending on the specifics of how the Toffoli gate is being used, each Toffoli can be converted to Clifford gates and between 4 and 7 T-gates [31]. Other applications in quantum chemistry tend to require even more T-gates [32\u2013 34]. Even with the most recent method, a completely distillation-free approach cannot yet reach an error rate required for these applications. Therefore, an outstanding question is whether it is possible to bring down the cost of T-gate even further, so that its cost is comparable to other Clifford gates in this regime.\n\nThis paper introduces a different protocol that aims to achieve a similar goal. Unlike the recent protocols that aim to measure a transversal Clifford gate [24, 25], our approach aims to exploit a code with a non-Clifford transversal gate; such an approach was suggested as an alternative possibility very recently in Ref. [25]. More specifically, we use the 3D color code [35], and focus on its simplest instance, which is the 15-qubit quantum Reed-Muller code (qRM). We will aim to use the transversal gate of the 3D color code, which is then converted to the 2D color code [36, 37]. While a careful study has suggested that preparation of magic state using 3D color code using this approach is more costly than the multi-level distillation method [38], a more recent work exploited post-selection and flag-qubits [19\u201321] to improve the performance [23]. Our approach is similar in spirit, though we use the flag qubits in a different way and also uses a novel transversal gate between 3D color code and 2D color code (that is equivalent up to a transversal unitary to the recently discovered gate in Ref. [39], which appeared during the preparation of our manuscript.) Overall, our approach yields a high quality magic state on par with these prior results, which we discuss further in Section II.\n\nAlthough our protocol has a logical infidelity lower than what was reported in Ref. [24, 25] for similar setups (in terms of the code being used and the physical error rate), they are incomparable. Ref. [24, 25] focused on quantum computing architectures equipped with nearest-neighbor gates on a two-dimensional grid, targeting superconducting qubit-based quantum computers [40]. Our approach uses gates that would require non-local connectivity. As such, our scheme, as it stands, cannot be used directly on these devices.\n\nWe emphasize, however, that our protocol is aimed at other types of quantum computers, such as the ones based on photons [41\u201343], ions [44\u201346], and neutral atoms [47, 48]. Non-local gates can be accommodated in these architectures, making them promising candidates to implement our protocol.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we compare our protocol to the other related protocols in the literature. In Section III, we review aspects of color codes. In Section IV, we describe our protocol. In Section V we describe our simulation method and present the result. We end with a discussion in Section VI.\n\n#### II. COMPARISON WITH PRIOR WORK\n\nA comparison of the infidelity of magic states prepared in our protocol with some recent results in the literature can be found in Table I and II.\n\nA common feature of all these protocols is that they rely on some degree of post-selection. However, there is also a difference in the overall approach. Our protocol (similar to Ref. [23]) uses a transversal non-Clifford gate, whereas Ref. [24, 25, 49] uses the measurement of logical Clifford operators.\n\n<T>\n|  | Uniform depolarizing noise |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Method | Infidelity | Acceptance rate |\n| Our protocol (error correction) | 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u00b1 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 | 84% |\n| Butt et al [23] | 10\u22124 | 94% |\n| Our protocol(\u2217) (post-selection) | 5.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 | 84% |\n| Gidney et al [25] | 6 \u00d7 10\u22127 | 65% |\n| Itogawa et al [24] | 10\u22124 | 70% |\n</T>\nSource 7:\n# Low-overhead magic state distillation with color codes\n\nSeok-Hyung Lee,1, \u2217 Felix Thomsen,1 Nicholas Fazio,1 Benjamin J.

Magic state distillation is the most well-studied method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two distillation schemes based on the 15 to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, which differ in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme uses faulty T-measurement, offering resource efficiency when the target infidelity is above a certain threshold (\u223c 35p 3 for physical error rate p). To achieve lower infidelities while maintaining resource efficiency, our second scheme exploits a distillation-free fault-tolerant magic state preparation protocol, achieving significantly lower infidelities (e.g., \u223c 10\u221219 for p = 10\u22124 ) than the first scheme. Notably, our schemes outperform the best existing magic state distillation methods for color codes by up to about two orders of magnitude in resource costs for a given achievable target infidelity.\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nA large-scale quantum computer should possess two properties: universality and fault tolerance. Universality refers to the capability of applying any unitary operations on qubits with arbitrary accuracy. This is achievable if the computer can implement a universal set of gates, which commonly includes the Hadamard gate (H), phase gate (S = Z 1/2 ), controlled-not (cnot) gate, and T gate (T = Z 1/4 ) [1]. While there is flexibility in this choice of gate set, for universality it must contain at least one non-Clifford gate, such as the T gate in this example. Fault tolerance is essential due to the noisy physical environments that may corrupt quantum information stored in qubits. Stabilizer quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes can be employed for fault-tolerant quantum memories (i.e., idling operations), provided that the physical noise strength is sufficiently low. However, implementing every gate in a universal set of gates fault-tolerantly remains a far more challenging task.\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) color codes [2, 3] are a family of stabilizer QEC codes defined on a trivalent and 3-colorable lattice of qubits, which can be constructed using only local interactions. Compared with surface codes [4, 5], color codes use fewer physical qubits per logical qubit at a given code distance [6] and have richer topological structures [7]. This allows an arbitrary pair of multi-qubit Pauli operators to be measured in parallel via lattice surgery [8]. Additionally, the 7-qubit Steane code, a small example of a color code with distance 3, has been recently demonstrated [9\u201313], exhibiting not only memory experiments but also the implementation of nontrivial gates.\n\nWith color codes, logical Clifford gates can be faulttolerantly implemented efficiently using transversal gates [2, 14] or lattice surgery [7, 8, 15]. However, the faulttolerant implementation of logical non-Clifford gates is rather challenging. One well-studied method to achieve this is by employing magic state distillation (MSD) [16\u2013 22], a scheme that distills high-quality logical magic states (specific non-stabilizer states) from multiple faulty magic states. The distilled magic states are then consumed to implement desired non-Clifford gates on logical qubits. For instance, the state \fT := \f0 + e i\u03c0/4 \f1 , where \f0 and \f1 are the logical basis states, can be used to execute the logical T gate or, more generally, any \u03c0/8-rotation gate P \u03c0/8 := e \u2212i(\u03c0/8)P , where P is a logical Pauli operator on multiple logical qubits. (Throughout the paper, we omit normalization factors of quantum states unless necessary and use overlines to denote logical states or operators.)\n\nMSD is generally resource-intensive due to its demand for a significant number of logical Clifford gates between multiple logical qubits. Therefore, when applying it to a specific quantum error-correcting code, the procedure should be tailored and optimized for that code at both the logical and physical levels, in order to minimize its resource cost. Such adaptations have been well studied for surface codes, notably by Litinski [23], reducing its cost by orders of magnitude compared to previous proposals. The scheme in Ref. [23] is based on two key ideas: (i) Distillation circuits can be designed in a way that many faulty \u03c0/8-rotations are executed on a small number of logical qubits (e.g., 15 \u03c0/8-rotations on five logical qubits in the 15-to-1 MSD protocol), and (ii) ancillary logical qubits for the scheme can have smaller code\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> seokhyung.lee@sydney.edu.au\n\n<sup>\u2020</sup> stephen.bartlett@sydney.edu.au\n\ndistances than the code distance dout of the logical qubit outputting the distilled magic state. More specifically, the code distance dZ with respect to Z errors on ancillary logical qubits can be chosen to be smaller than dout, since such Z errors are detectable by the final X measurements of the circuit.\nSource 8:\n# Fault Tolerant Non-Clifford State Preparation for Arbitrary Rotations\n\nHyeongrak Choi,1, \u2217 Frederic T.

However, logical operations on error-corrected qubits require a significant resource overhead, especially for high-precision and high-fidelity non-Clifford rotation gates. To address this issue, we propose a postselection-based algorithm to efficiently prepare resource states for gate teleportation. Our algorithm achieves fault tolerance, demonstrating the exponential suppression of logical errors with code distance, and it applies to any stabilizer codes. We provide analytical derivations and numerical simulations of the fidelity and success probability of the algorithm. We benchmark the method on surface code and show a factor of 102 to 104 reduction in space-time overhead compared to existing methods. Overall, our approach presents a promising path to reducing the resource requirement for quantum algorithms on error-corrected and noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.\n\n### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nPractical quantum computers should reliably store and process quantum information in the presence of noise and error. Quantum error correction (QEC) encodes information into a set of physical qubits to protect them from environmental noises. Moreover, to overcome erroneous physical operations, one needs to apply only faulttolerant (FT) gates to encoded logical qubits. Transversal gates achieve this by prohibiting errors from propagating within a code block. Unfortunately, it has been proven that there is no code with universal transversal gate set [1, 2].\n\nAn alternative route to FT gates is preparing ancillae in a state not accessible from transversal gates and gate-teleport them [3]. Logical states of a code are often constructed with state injection [4]. The fidelity of this logical state is limited by the fidelity of the ancilla state regardless of the code distance. Moreover, even for a perfect ancilla state, the single-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelities limit the fidelity of the logical state. This is because the information to be injected is in a physical qubit and needs to pass through the gates for encoding.\n\nFor fault-tolerant computing, a conventional approach to prepare an ancilla is magic state distillation [3]. In a magic state distillation, error detection is performed on faulty logical qubits with the inner code embedding transversal non-Clifford gate [5]. Alternatively, a code with transversal Clifford gates can be used for transversal Clifford measurement [6]. 15-to-1 Reed-Muller code has been widely studied [7], but other codes [5, 6] and multilevel distillation [8] have been also proposed.\n\nThe overhead of distillation is often significantly higher than that of a Clifford operation. For example, a recent study [9] showed that the surface code implementation of the distillation circuit only requires \u223c 4.71d 3 (d = 13) space-time cost (i.e., qubits multiplied by cycles) for pL \u223c 10\u22129 logical error rate provided physical error rate of p = 10\u22124 , which is only \u223c 5 times more expensive than the Clifford gate taking d 3 qubit cycles. However, achieving pL < 10\u221210 with realistic p = 10\u22123 requires > 30d 3 qubit-cycles. Moreover, the relative cost is much higher for codes with a higher encoding rate or a lower threshold. Alternatively, transversal T-measurement on 2D color code augmented with flag qubits and redundant ancilla has shown a low overhead distillation [10]. Although it is 2D compatible and can be code-switched to surface code using lattice surgery [11], the low threshold of 0.2% [12] limits its usage to a system with a very low physical error rate of p \u2248 10\u22124 .\n\n# Fault Tolerant Non-Clifford State Preparation for Arbitrary Rotations\n\nThere have been a few ways to bypass the distillation. 1) Code switching with 3D Gauge color code implements transversal T-gate with gauge fixing [13, 14]. However, the threshold is much lower (\u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 for single-qubit Pauli-X errors) [15], it strictly requires a 3D physical connectivity, and the resource overhead is still higher than the distillation [16]. 2) The code deformations of the 2D surface code effectively perform the 3D surface code and enable the transversal CCZ gate [17]. The problem is that this requires local three-dimensional operations for a transversal CCZ of three copies of the surface code patch. Essentially, by the Bravyi-Koenig bound, one needs at least a three-dimensional code for transversal non-Clifford gates [18].\n\nIn addition, a fault-tolerant implementation of arbitrary-angle rotations requires multiple T-gates [19\u2013 21]. Such implementation is practically important because, for example, quantum simulation of 100 orbitals requires 1012 single-qubit rotations with angle \u03b8 \u2248 10\u22127 [22\u201324], resulting in a formidable resource overhead.\n\n<sup>2</sup>Computer Science, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60615, USA\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> choihr@mit.edu\n\n<sup>\u2020</sup> chong@cs.uchicago.edu\n\n<sup>\u2021</sup> englund@mit.edu\n\n<sup>\u00a7</sup> yongshan.ding@yale.edu\n\nRecently, T count was greatly reduced by parity-checking protocol [25, 26] and improved by the so-called \"synthilation\" [27]. In synthilation, gate synthesis is optimized in conjunction with distillation in a single step. However, even with quadratic suppression of the T-error rate, performing multiple stages of synthilation for arbitraryangle rotations remains challenging. Moreover, a large number of logical qubits with enough distances unavoidably takes many physical qubits.\n\nThe oxymoron is that small-angle rotations, almost the same as Clifford gates, require more resources than a T gate, which is farthest from the Clifford octahedron on the Bloch sphere equator. Our work aims to fill this gap using a novel scheme for preparing arbitrary-angle exotic magic states in a resource-efficient way.\n\nHere, we present a method for fault-tolerantly preparing a broad family of non-Clifford states. Our method achieves fault tolerance by taking advantage of postselection through a quantum error detecting code. We demonstrate its fault-tolerance property by showing that the logical error rate decays exponentially with the code distance. We also analyze the commonly ignored coherent errors and show that they can be statistically suppressed. Furthermore, we introduce a technique called \"rotation scaffolding\" to boost the success rate of a logical rotation gate. As a result, the protocol reduces the space-time overhead of preparing non-Clifford states by several orders of magnitude. Compared to existing methods, our method uses a factor of 102 to 104 lower spacetime cost to achieve a logical error rate of 10\u22128 to 10\u22124 . This is especially useful for bootstrapping NISQ devices into near-term FT systems. The generated states can be fed into other existing distillation protocols for even lower error rates.\n\n### II. NON-CLIFFORD STATE PREPARATION\n\nFigure 1 illustrates our proposal for FT preparation of non-Clifford states with the three-qubit phase-flip code. Our protocol starts with a fault-tolerantly initialized Clifford state. For simplicity, we choose in the example |+Li = |+ + +i (Fig. 1, left) 1 . We apply physical Z\u02c6-rotation gates, with a small rotation angle 2, to the three physical qubits. This results in the state \u2248 |+ + +i \u2212 i3 |\u2212 \u2212 \u2212i + (other terms). These other terms omitted here are a linear combination of singlequbit or two-qubit flipped states, with probability amplitudes of i and \u2212 2 , respectively (Fig. 1, middle). Then, quantum error detection rejects the wavefunction outside the logical space, projecting the state into |+Li\u2212i3 |\u2212Li. The resulting state is a rotated |+Li state around z axis by \u22122 3 . The inset of Fig. 1 shows the quantum error\n\ndetection with the phase-flip code. If the syndrome measurements are successful, i.e. X\u02c6 1X\u02c6 2 = 1 and X\u02c6 2X\u02c6 3 = 1, the code accepts the state. Otherwise, the state is given up, and the procedure is repeated.\n\nOur method can be generalized to any quantum errorcorrecting codes. Here, we first focus on the [[n, 1, d]] code with a logical Z operator,\n\n$$\\hat{Z}_{L}=\\prod_{i=1,\\ldots,d}\\hat{Z}_{i},\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad(1)$$\n\nwhere Z\u02c6 i is a Pauli-Z\u02c6 operator acting on the i-labeled qubit. Rotating all physical qubits in Z\u02c6L, i.e., the support of Z\u02c6L, around the Z axis by \u03b8 gives\n\n$$\\bigotimes_{i=1,\\ldots,d}\\hat{R}_{z,i}(\\theta)=\\tag{2}$$\n\n$$\\sum_{n_{I}}\\cos^{(d-n_{I})}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\left(i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right)^{n_{I}}\\prod_{\\begin{array}{c}i=1,..,d\\\\ \\#I_{i}=n_{I}\\end{array}}\\left\\{\\hat{I}_{i},\\hat{Z}_{i}\\right\\}.\\tag{3}$$\nSource 9:\n## 1 Introduction\n\nDespite their separate impracticalities, both [18] and [19] represent significant theoretical breakthroughs. In particular, they both gave inspiration for the present work. As a key example, Krishna and Tillich in [19] generalised the notion of binary triorthogonal matrices to a definition of triorthogonal matrices over the field Fp, where p is a prime, where again the definition is made in view of defining a quantum code (on p-dimensional qudits) that supports a non-Clifford transversal gate.\n\n### 1.1 Overview of Our Results\n\nIt has been an important open question as to whether protocols may be designed with \u03b3 made arbitrarily close to 0 for qubits. The main contributions of this paper are not only to answer this in the affirmative but also to determine that constant-overhead magic state distillation is possible, i.e. \u03b3 = 0, for qubits (see also Table 1).\n\nTheorem 1.1. Constant-overhead magic state distillation for qubits is possible. In particular, there exist constants \u03a9, pth such that, for any target error rate \u01eb, there is a large enough n such that a supply of n |CCZi magic states of error rate below pth may be used to produce k |CCZi magic states of error rate below \u01eb, under the local stochastic error model, where n/k \u2264 \u03a9.\n\n<T>\n| Work | Year | Overhead Exponent \u03b3 | Qudit Dimension d |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hastings and Haah [18] | 2017 | \u03b3 \u2248 0.678 | d = 2 |\n| Krishna and Tillich [19] | 2018 | \u03b3 \u2192 0 | d \u2192 \u221e |\n| Present Work | 2024 | \u03b3 = 0 | d = 2 |\nTable 1: The overhead for magic state distillation is O(log\u03b3 (1/\u01eb)), for a target error rate \u01eb, as discussed. This table presents the result of this work in comparison to the previous state of the art.\n</T>\n\nOur main construction is geared around the distillation of the |CCZi state, which enables the execution of the (non-Clifford) CCZ gate via stabiliser operations only, using a gate teleportation protocol. In addition, one may also achieve constant-overhead magic state distillation in the same sense as Theorem 1.1 (possibly with different constants) for the |T i gate by using known protocols to convert |CCZi states to |T i states [20\u2013 23].\n\nAt a high level, there are two ingredients that allow us to prove Theorem 1.1. The first is a qubit code which is asymptotically good (meaning it has essentially optimal density of information storage and\n\n<sup>1</sup>The notation [[n, k, d]] is a canonical notation for a quantum code with n physical qubits, k logical qubits (we say the code has dimension k), and distance d.\n\nerror-correcting capability: k, d = \u0398(n)) that also supports a non-Clifford transversal gate. The second is a triorthogonality framework for prime-power qudits (in fact, for 2 10-dimensional qudits) which generalises the framework of Bravyi and Haah [13] for qubits and that of Krishna and Tillich [19] for prime-dimensional qudits. We also show the translation between a 2 10-dimensional qudit and 10 qubits. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is essentially the work of the entire paper, but the conclusion comes in Section 6 in the form of Theorem 6.1.\n\nBecause our construction of a quantum code may be of interest in other contexts, we will enunciate it as its own theorem here. This theorem will be established via the results of Sections 3 and 5, in particular, Theorem 5.1.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [13] Sergey Bravyi and Jeongwan Haah.

To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical CCZ gate, enabling a universal set of fault-tolerant operations. Independently, we demonstrate that certain stabilizer codes can be concatenated in a measurementfree way without having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is achieved by means of the disposable Toffoli gadget, which realizes the feedback operation in a resource-efficient way. For the purpose of benchmarking the proposed protocols with circuit-level noise, we implement an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits consisting of few Hadamard gates. In particular, our findings support that below-breakeven logical performance is achievable with a depolarizing error rate below 10\u22123 . Altogether, the deformation protocol and the Toffoli gadget provide a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, which is particularly suited for state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nLarge-scale quantum computation will rely on the implementation of quantum error correction (QEC), which is essential for accurate quantum information processing [1, 2]. Given the inherently noisy nature of quantum hardware, it is crucial to engineer systems that can mitigate the spread of faults. The strategy involves encoding logical information into a specific subspace within the broader physical Hilbert space\u2014often through non-local encoding\u2014allowing the system to be resilient against local errors. This redundancy, while effective, significantly increases the resource demands of QEC. As a result, the optimal choice of error-correction protocol should be tailored to the specific quantum computing hardware, both to minimize overhead and exploit the platform's unique characteristics. Despite these complexities, recent experimental breakthroughs have marked remarkable progress in QEC across different architectures, such as superconducting qubits [3\u201311], trapped ions [12\u201321], nitrogen vacancies in diamonds [22], and neutral-atom arrays [23\u201326].\n\nIn traditional QEC approaches, a partial measurement of the system, known as the error syndrome, is used to inform a classical decoding algorithm, which then determines the corrective actions applied to the system\u2014either through physical intervention or software-based adjustments [1]. These partial measurements often correspond to stabilizer operators, which commute with logical operators, such that the logical state remains unaffected [27].\n\nIn some quantum computing platforms, such as those based on neutral atoms or trapped ions, the relatively slow nature of such measurements often hinders the efficiency of this syndrome extraction [17, 18, 23, 28\u201332]. An alternative approach, measurement-free (MF) QEC, has emerged as a promising solution [33\u201339], replacing classical processing with purely unitary dynamics. In MF QEC,\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_0_Figure_12.jpeg</img>\nFigure 1. (a) The stabilizers of the 3 \u00d7 3 Bacon Shor code, with red (blue) areas depicting the support of X-type (Z-type) stabilizer operators. (b) Any Bacon-Shor code has a gauge freedom. In particular, the pairwise ZiZj gauges along rows can be chosen to be +1, resulting in a Shor code. We call this the Shor gauge. To perform a logical CCZ, each logical qubit must start from this gauge, and then be extended to a 3 \u00d7 9 Bacon-Shor code, as shown in (c). The logical CCZ is then performed between logical qubits, by a transversal application of physical CCZ gates, with permutations across the columns. (d) To return to the original 3 \u00d7 3 configuration, a shrink move is performed. (e) To increase the tolerance to errors, concatenation of the same code is performed, where the data qubits of a code are composed of logical qubits at a lower level.\n</F>\n\nthe dissipative dynamics needed to remove the entropy introduced by noise is achieved through reset operations or a continuous supply of fresh ancilla qubits, which has been recently demonstrated in neutral-atom platforms [40\u2013 42]. In particular, the first fully fault-tolerant (FT) pro-\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> giacomo.giudice@planqc.eu\n\nposal correcting a single error was achieved in Ref. [38], by adapting Steane-type error correction techniques [43]. Later, some of the authors of this work showed that by using redundant syndrome information, low-overhead alternatives can been formulated as well [39].\n\nThe notion of fault-tolerance is essential for the design of an error-corrected quantum computer. Broadly speaking, an FT implementation is capable of limiting error propagation, thus reducing the logical error rates, as long as the physical error rate remains below a certain threshold. This is relevant both for the QEC round (which must not inject additional errors during its noisy execution), and for logical operations. Transversal operations are particularly appealing, since they are straightforwardly FT [1]. Transversal operations correspond to a singlelayer of physical gates, each of which acts on at most one physical qubit of each logical qubit. Therefore, errors can propagate between logical qubits, but remain correctable, since QEC is applied to each logical qubit individually.\n\nHowever, it is well known that no QEC code can have a transversal universal gate set [44], and, in particular, the only transversal gates for two-dimensional codes are unitaries belonging to the Clifford group [45]. Several ways have been proposed to get around these no-go results. These include magic state distillation [46\u201350], code switching between appropriate codes [51\u201353], using non-local connectivity between Bacon-Shor codes [54], implementing pieceable constructions where operations are intertwined with intermediate error correction [55], or allowing for a loss of distance in concatenated codes [56\u201358]."

Hmm, this sounds complex but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that quantum computing relies on qubits and quantum states, which are delicate and prone to errors. Traditional methods like quantum error correction (QEC) have been successful in mitigating these errors under certain noise models, like Markovian noise, where the noise is memoryless. But real-world noise often isn't just Markovian; it can be non-Markovian, meaning the environment depends on the history of the system, which makes it harder to model and detect errors.\n\nSo, I need an algorithm that works in real-time under such conditions. Quantum-classical hybrid algorithms mix quantum processing with classical methods, allowing for adaptability. But how do these elements interact when dealing with non-Markovian noise?\n\nI remember that superconducting qubits are great because they can be easily scaled and fault-tolerant. But their implementation also requires precise control over parameters like temperature, magnetic fields, etc., which might not be perfectly stable under non-Markovian noise.\n\nLet me think about the main components:\n\n1. **Quantum Processing Units (QPU):** Superconducting qubits can run certain quantum algorithms directly. Quantum Phase Estimation and Grover's algorithm come to mind. These could process parts of the problem, but for real-time error detection, a classical controller is probably needed.\n\n2. **Classical Control:** This handles measurements, parameter estimation, and error correction. The classical side needs to monitor the qubits in real time, adjust parameters dynamically, and communicate with quantum processors when necessary.\n\n3. **Non-Markovian Noise Models:** Since the noise doesn't have a memory, techniques like machine learning or recurrent neural networks might be useful for modeling the noise history based on recent system states.\n\n4. **Real-Time Processing:** The algorithm must process data as it arrives without waiting for all information to be known, which is challenging because each qubit interacts with its environment in a non-trivial way.\n\nPutting this together, I think the hybrid approach would involve using quantum processing units (like variational algorithms) on a subset of qubits while the classical side uses machine learning models and real-time data analysis to detect errors, adjust parameters for the qubits, and prevent them from affecting others too much. This could be integrated with control strategies that use feedback or reinforcement learning to adaptively modify the system's parameters.\n\nI'm not sure about specific algorithms or techniques used in each part. For example, how exactly would the classical controller estimate the noise history? Maybe using a recurrent neural network trained on recent measurements to predict future noise based on non-Markovian patterns.\n\nAlso, I need to consider practical implementation aspects, like how the system can scale, error correction mechanisms that are robust against non-Markovian noise, and hardware limitations that might affect real-time performance. Ensuring that both quantum and classical components work together seamlessly is crucial for this approach.\n\nI'm not entirely confident about all these details, so I should review some related research or textbooks to solidify my understanding before finalizing the algorithm design.\n</think>\n\nDesigning a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for real-time error mitigation in non-Markovian noise environments using superconducting qubits involves integrating both quantum and classical components.

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how a quantum processor can be used for topological quantum computing. From what I remember, topological quantum computing relies on topological qubits, which are qubits that are more stable against errors because they are encoded in the topological properties of some system. \n\nI think these systems use something called anyons, which are particles that obey fractional statistics. Examples include quasiparticles like anyons in fractional quantum Hall systems. So maybe each logical qubit is represented by an anyon, and operations on them would be done through braiding these anyons.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe topological qubits are also known as Majorana fermions or something similar. I should look into that more, but for now, I'll proceed with the idea of anyons being the key to stability in quantum computing.\n\nSo if a processor has multiple qubits connected together, maybe through some interaction like fluxes or electric charges, these can become anyons when they are braided around each other. This would create a way to perform operations without relying on local connectivity, which is essential for error correction because it's hard to maintain coherence in a quantum system otherwise.\n\nI've heard about surface codes and topological stabilizer codes, like the toric code or the Fibonacci anyon model. These are supposed to be good for fault-tolerant quantum computing using anyons. So if the processor has enough qubits arranged into such a lattice, it could be used to perform these operations.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the specifics of how exactly this would work on a physical processor. Maybe by manipulating fluxes or charges and braiding them around each other, you can implement gates. But wait, do you actually need anyons as the basic building blocks? Or are they just another term for something else?\n\nAlso, I'm trying to think about practical implementations. The 5-qubit surface code is a well-known example. How would that be scaled up on current processors with more qubits and longer times between operations? Maybe using some entanglement to stabilize the anyonic states.\n\nAnother thing I'm unsure about is whether all the gates can be implemented without error correction. If it's fault-tolerant, you have error suppression as part of the algorithm, but if not, maybe you need additional steps to manage errors during processing.\n\nI remember reading that some processors have built-in error correction mechanisms, which would help with topological quantum computing too. Maybe the processor is already in a state where it inherently supports anyonic operations through its physical layout and interactions between qubits.\n\nBut I'm still not clear on how the actual braiding of anyons translates into observable operations. How do you induce braidings? Are there specific procedures or sequences of gates that would perform these operations?\n\nI think about this: in quantum computing, each gate operation is a rotation or displacement in some parameter space. For topological systems, perhaps you have more complex transformations when you manipulate the anyons. Maybe you can create certain braiding patterns by applying controlled operations on subsets of qubits.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused between logical gates and physical gates. Logical gates are the actual operations you perform on the encoded information, while physical gates are the manipulations of the qubits in space. So for topological quantum computing, you might use physical gates to create certain anyonic braids, and then later measure the state to get back the logical result.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's how it works or if there are more direct ways to implement operations on the encoded information without needing to manipulate qubits in space. Maybe some of the algorithms for topological quantum computing rely heavily on these anyonic braids, performing certain transformations through the manipulation of the qubits' phases and positions.\n\nAlso, I'm not entirely clear on what the \"anyon\" terminology means beyond it being a quasiparticle that has non-Abelian statistics. Do all particles fall into this category? Or is that just for anyons in specific systems like topological superconductors?\n\nI think it's more about the braiding around each other, and how their exchange affects the state of the system. So if you have three qubits arranged in a loop, moving one through the others would change the overall phase or state in a non-trivial way.\n\nBut maybe I'm mixing this up with things like quasiparticles being anyons in other contexts, not just quantum computing. For example, Majorana fermions are also considered anyons, but they're more about their properties as particles and their behavior on a large scale rather than within a small system of qubits.\n\nI should probably look into the basics of topological qubit models again. The toric code is often used for topological quantum computing because it's based on a lattice where excitations are anyons, and measurements can detect them through boundaries or interfaces.\n\nSo in a processor with a two-dimensional grid of qubits, maybe some operations create fluxes or charges that form the anyon types needed. For example, a string of fluxes could represent one type of anyon, while another arrangement represents another anyon type.\n\nWhen you perform braiding operations on these anyons\u2014like moving one through others\u2014you end up applying certain gates to the encoded qubits. But how does this translate into operations that can be implemented on actual qubits in a processor?\n\nI think I might need to delve deeper into how the logical operators are constructed from physical operations on the qubits, which could involve measuring certain observables and using those results to determine the effect of braiding.\n\nWait, but if the processor is already in a state where it can perform these anyonic transformations through its interactions, maybe you don't need additional gates. Instead, each physical operation corresponds to some transformation that affects the anyon states, and this leads to a logical gate when measured.\n\nI'm still not entirely clear on whether all the necessary quantum operations are already present in the processor or if they require being synthesized into separate gates. It might be more about how these qubits are entangled and manipulated through their interactions rather than through physical gates.\n\nIn any case, I think the key takeaway is that topological quantum computing relies on using the non-Abelian statistics of anyons\u2014particles that obey fractional statistics\u2014by braiding them around each other in a lattice. The processor's qubits form this lattice, and by manipulating their interactions (like applying electric or magnetic fields), you can create these anyons and perform braidings to implement logical operations.\n\nI should probably look into specific examples of how this works on current processors, maybe like the 9-qubit surface code being scaled up. But since I don't have real-time access to information, I'll have to rely on what I know.\n\nSo in summary, a quantum processor with topological qubits would allow operations through braiding anyons, which are particles that can exist in non-local states and exhibit fractional statistics. The physical layout of the qubits and interactions enable these braiding operations, leading to fault-tolerant computation by measuring the resulting entanglement patterns.\n</think>\n\nTopological quantum computing is a promising approach for building fault-tolerant quantum computers by leveraging the unique properties of anyons\u2014particles that obey non-Abelian statistics. The key concepts revolve around using the topological qubits, which are encoded in the system's geometric properties rather than local connectivity.\n\n1. **Anyons and Topological Qubits**: Anyons are particles whose exchange properties lead to a form of quantum statistics different from bosons or fermions. These can be observed as quasiparticles in systems like fractional quantum Hall systems. Topological qubits use these anyons, often embedded in lattices, as the fundamental units of information.\n\n2. **Braiding Operations**: To perform logical operations, topological qubits rely on braiding anyons. This involves moving one anyon around another without directly interacting them, creating non-trivial exchange effects that affect the encoded quantum state.\n\n3. **Quantum Processor's Role**: A quantum processor with a lattice of qubits can simulate this environment. The interactions and manipulations within the qubit system enable braiding by applying physical operations (e.g., electric or magnetic fields) to create anyonic states.\n\n4. **Fault-Tolerance and Error Correction**: While some processors may inherently support error correction, topological quantum computing often requires additional protocols. Implementing these through the processor's interactions allows for robust logical operations based on measured observables.\n\n5. **Logical Gates and Transformations**: Physical operations manipulate qubits into anyonic states, which are then measured to yield results corresponding to logical gates. These transformations are non-local and inherently fault-tolerant due to the system's geometric structure.\n\nIn conclusion, topological quantum computing uses the non-Abelian statistics of anyons in a lattice-based system. The processor's physical operations enable braiding these anyons, leading to fault-tolerant computation through measured observables. This approach leverages the inherent complexity and stability of topological qubits, offering a promising path for scalable quantum computing.",

However, prior investigations have predominantly been focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose a non-Markovian Noise Mitigation(NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions(BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that will make the error mitigation algorithms environmentaware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on a spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nQuantum algorithms have established theoretical advantage over classical methods in tasks such as integer factorization [Sho99] and quantum simulations [LC19, Llo96, BCC+15, LC17], yet the experimental realization of this advantage remains elusive. Current quantum platforms face two major obstacles: the limited scalability of existing hardware and the inevitable effects of noise in quantum circuits. Quantum error correction (QEC) [NC10] suppresses the noise with qubits overhead, which requires extra scalability of the quantum computer. In contrast, quantum error mitigation (QEM) [TBG17, EBL18, CBB+23], tailored for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices [Pre18], reduces the effective noise through a sampling overhead rather than an increase in qubit resources.\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup>Department of Mathematics, The Pennsylvania State University wangke.math@psu.edu\n\n<sup>\u2020</sup>Department of Mathematics, The Pennsylvania State University xiantao.li@psu.edu\n\nContinuous QEM is a scheme that has been observed to be compatible with digital quantum computers (DQC) and certain regimes of analog quantum computers (AQC) [SYT+21]. In DQC, gate-based quantum circuits are implemented by using digital pulses, where the noises are simplified to a quantum channel before or after the ideal gate [GMMGdAS24]. Both DQC and AQC inherently involve continuous quantum state evolution, allowing master-equation-based treatments of noise to closely mimic experimental procedures [CBB+23]. In this framework, the change of the quantum state on a noiseless circuit follows the time evolution according to the Liouville von Neumann equation,\n\n$\\partial_{t}\\rho_{I}(t)=-i\\left[H_{S},\\rho_{I}(t)\\right].$\n\nThis ideal operation, without the interference from the environment noise, is denoted by a unitary channel EI , such that \u03c1I (t + \u03b4t) = EI (t + \u03b4t, t)\u03c1I (t) for any time interval \u03b4t.\n\nOn the other hand, in the presence of Markovian noise, the dynamics of the state (denoted by \u03c1N ) follows the Lindblad dynamics,\n\n$\\partial_{t}\\rho_{N}(t)=-i\\left[H_{S},\\rho_{N}(t)\\right]+{\\cal L}_{N}\\rho_{N}(t)$.  \n\nSimilarly, the noisy operation induces a quantum channel EN such that \u03c1N (t + \u03b4t) = EN (t + \u03b4t, t)\u03c1N (t). A direct derivation of the Lindblad equation [Car13] shows that LN could include both the decoherence and coherence noise.\n\nIn order to mitigate the noise introduced by the dissipative operator LN in Eq. (2), the recovery operator EQ(t, t + \u03b4t) can be introduced, with the idea to reverse the influence from the noise, i.e., EQ(t, t+\u03b4t)EN (t+\u03b4t, t) \u2248 EI (t+\u03b4t, t) [TBG17]. The design of EQ(t, t+\u03b4t) often involves propagating the noise operator LN operator backward in time, and we reversed t and t + \u03b4t in EQ to reflect this perspective. Unfortunately, the recovery operation is generally a non-physical operation, in that it is no longer a quantum channel. Temme et al. [TBG17] proposed the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method, where the recovery operator is projected to a physical basis, {B\u2113}\u2113 , which can be directly implemented on quantum devices. Specifically, EQ(t, t+\u03b4t) = \u03b3(t, \u03b4t) P \u2113 \u03b1\u2113(t, \u03b4t)p\u2113(t, \u03b4t)B\u2113 with probability p\u2113 , the sign \u03b1\u2113 = \u00b11 and the normalization constant \u03b3(t, \u03b4t). Thus, the expectation of an observable O on the state \u03c1I (t + \u03b4t) after one step \u03b4t can be approximated as follows.\n\n$$\\mathrm{tr}\\big{(}O\\rho_{I}(t+\\delta t)\\big{)}=\\gamma(t,\\delta t)\\sum_{\\ell}\\alpha_{\\ell}p_{\\ell}\\,\\mathrm{tr}\\left(O\\mathcal{B}_{\\ell}\\mathcal{E}_{N}(t)\\rho_{N}(t)\\right).\\tag{3}$$\n\nIn practice, this scheme is repeated for each layer that corresponds to a time step in continuous QEM and the ensemble can be implemented via a direct Monte Carlo sampling with respect to the joint density of {p\u2113}. This PEC algorithm has been shown with improved gate fidelity in superconduct [SCW+19] and trapped ion [ZLZ+20] systems, and applied to various quantum algorithms, including variational quantum eigensolvers [SQC+21, JS22] and dynamic simulation of Ising spin chain [VDBMKT23], Fermi-Hubbard model [CZZ+23] and Lindblad simulations [GLV+23].\nSource 2:\n# Quantum Computing in Wireless Communications and Networking: A Tutorial-cum-Survey\n\nFinally, programmers need to find ways to mitigate various types of errors. In the NISQ era, hardware resources cannot support the significant consumption of applying quantum error correction code. Quantum error mitigation, which suppresses errors via classical postprocessing techniques, is the only practical approach to handle errors at this stage[70]. It requires the noise model in advance and then estimates parameters for the expected value of the noise-free model by analyzing how the noise model behaves under different noise levels. The other is probabilistic error cancellation based on gate set tomography [100], which does not know the precise physical noise model in advance. It combines linearly independent basis set operations and gate set tomography to fully remove the impact of localized Markovian errors by systematically measuring the effect of errors. This technique has been successfully implemented in trapped-ion systems and superconducting systems.\n\nnative gates customized for their architecture.\n\n#### *F. Quantum-inspired Algorithms*\n\nThe origin of quantum-inspired algorithms can be attributed to the integration of QC concepts into conventional algorithms. Typically, algorithms in this class are described as running on classical computers, with some steps imitating properties unique to the quantum realm.\n\nA subclass of these algorithms mentions the implementation on a quantum computer. Consider a QRL algorithm, which denotes the state transition via the measurements of an observable [86]. The previous state will collapse to one of the observable eigenstates (next state) associated with an action chosen probability by the agent. In theory, this seems plausible. Nevertheless, for a complex application scenario, physically representing and implementing an observable at each step could be an issue. Moreover, the no-cloning principle makes it unclear how to obtain sufficient independent quantum state copies for the statics of measurement results. Therefore, the algorithm is classified as quantum-inspired RL [101].\n\nThe second subclass of these algorithms explicitly states that they are running classically. A well-known example is Tang's work [102], in which a binary tree-like data structure is proposed to satisfy quantum state preparation assumptions. A classical algorithm exploiting this structure can output an \u2195 2 -norm sample from a rank-k approximation of a matrix in nearly polynomial time. The third category is named quantuminspired metaheuristic algorithm. As the name suggests, these algorithms modify steps of classical metaheuristic algorithms inspired by quantum principles so as to improve performance [103]. There are many related research works, including quantum ant colony algorithm [104], quantum evolutionary algorithm [105], QGA [106], QPSO [107], to solve wellknown fundamental NP-hard problems such as knapsack, traveling salesman to practical issues involving clustering, project scheduling, etc.\n\nThe modifications to quantum-inspired algorithms based on QC principles follow a similar pattern: utilizing qubits, or n-dimensional normalized vectors, to map and represent the original data, such as chromosomes in genetic algorithms; employing rotation gates or matrices to evolve qubits for exploration; using a random number generator to generate new feasible solutions, simulating quantum measurements collapsing to ground states; integrating entangled states in qubit representation, so that when creating a new population by measuring the qubit string (solution), the entangled qubit pairs in the solution diversify the data and help in avoiding stagnation of local optima.\n\nQuantum-inspired metaheuristic algorithms enhance optimization performance by leveraging QC concepts to accelerate convergence, enhance exploration and exploitation, and find the best solutions more effectively. However, most published work still requires in-depth complexity analysis to justify performance benefits. On the other hand, how to appropriately embed QC into optimization workflow, be compatible with the metaheuristic algorithms, and not reduce the algorithm's speed is still a concern.\n\n#### *G.

Sufficient noise characterization and modeling can provide key insights into the effect of noise on quantum algorithms and inform the design of targeted error protection protocols. However, constructing effective noise models that are sparse in model parameters, yet predictive can be challenging. In this work, we present an approach for effective noise modeling of multi-qubit operations on transmon-based devices. Through a comprehensive characterization of seven devices offered by the IBM Quantum Platform, we show that the model can capture and predict a wide range of single- and two-qubit behaviors, including non-Markovian effects resulting from spatio-temporally correlated noise sources. The model's predictive power is further highlighted through multi-qubit dynamical decoupling demonstrations and an implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver. As a training proxy for the hardware, we show that the model can predict expectation values within a relative error of 0.5%; this is a 7\u00d7 improvement over default hardware noise models. Through these demonstrations, we highlight key error sources in superconducting qubits and illustrate the utility of reduced noise models for predicting hardware dynamics.\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nSuperconducting qubits have emerged as one of the most promising quantum technologies for realizing practical quantum computing. Many types of superconducting qubit devices have been developed, and the field is rapidly evolving [1, 2]. Among the assortment of superconducting qubits, the transmon is specifically designed to minimize sensitivity to charge noise [3], and has been at the core of recent breakthroughs [4\u2013 9]. With the advent of enhanced control capabilities in cloudbased quantum computing such as IBM's Quantum Platform (IBMQP) [10], transmon-based devices have become a mainstream architecture employed to test state-of-the-art quantum algorithms.\n\nDespite advancements in scale and quality, noise in superconducting qubit architectures poses a crucial challenge. In order to manage noise in quantum applications, a wide range of techniques have been devised to suppress [11\u201314], avoid [15\u2013 19], correct [20, 21], and mitigate [22\u201329] errors. The benefits of many of these approaches have been showcased on superconducting hardware via demonstrations of dynamical decoupling (DD) [30\u201334], decoherence-free subspaces [35\u201337], quantum error correcting codes [38\u201344], and various quantum error mitigation protocols [45\u201348].\n\nMany error management (EM) protocols rely on knowledge of the underlying noise processes. Such information can be leveraged for the purposes of ensuring that specific assumptions are satisfied (e.g., Markovianity). It can also be crucial in assessing the inherent robustness and susceptibility of an EM protocol \u2013 and more generally, any quantum algorithm \u2013 to hardware-relevant noise sources. These can be key steps in properly devising targeted EM protocols and noise robust quantum algorithms.\n\nThe most common approaches to modeling noisy quantum dynamics rely on the quantum channel formalism, quantum master equations (MEs), or the stochastic Hamiltonian formalism. The first approach involves applying a composition of quantum error maps before or after an ideal gate operation. The channel representation aims to sacrifice modeling of intragate dynamics for simplicity and fewer model parameters [49]. Furthermore, there is typically an assumption of Markovianity (i.e., memoryless environment) which in part results in neglecting potential inter-gate correlations. In contrast, MEs are based on physically motivated differential equations that arise from the theory of open quantum systems [49\u201351]. They allow for more accurate descriptions of Markovian and non-Markovian system-environment interactions at the expense of added model and computational complexity.\n\nThe stochastic Hamiltonian formalism relies on modeling system-environment interactions via a semi-classical Hamiltonian [52\u201356]. System operators couple to stochastic, timedependent, variables as opposed to additional quantum degrees of freedom. This mean-field approach enables modeling of noisy quantum dynamics resulting from spatio-temporally correlated error processes by averaging time evolved quantum states over random realizations of the noise. The advantage of the stochastic Hamiltonian approach lies in the trade-off between Hilbert space size and parametric complexity, which has proven particularly useful when non-Markovian noise is present [57, 58].\n\nEach strategy has been investigated as a means for modeling noise in superconducting qubits. Models based on compositions of Markovian quantum channels have had variable success [59\u201362], with sparse Pauli-Lindblad models [63, 64] providing the strongest agreement [5]. This comes at the cost of noise tailoring via Pauli twirling [65, 66], which can incur progressively larger sampling overheads as system size increases.\n\nME-based techniques have achieved substantially more success in modeling superconducting qubit devices. Although the presence of Markovian environmental noise sources are prominently observed in superconducting qubits [2], recent studies have highlighted substantial contributions from non-Markovian sources as well. For example, Post-Markovian [67] and Redfield [68, 69] based MEs have shown to agree well with single- and two-qubit demonstrations. In addition, extensions of the Lindblad master equation (LME) [49, 70] that include non-Markovian contributions via stochastic unraveling [71] or the addition of quantum degrees of freedom [72] have also shown promise in the study of multi-qubit dynamics. Albeit successful, it is unclear if these approaches will remain viable as system sizes increase. Computational costs associated with obtaining solutions to multi-qubit dynamical equations and model training costs must be balanced to ensure scalability.\nSource 4:\n# Multi-time quantum process tomography on a superconducting qubit\n\nChristina Giarmatzi,1, 2, \u2217 Tyler Jones,2, 3, 4, \u2217 Alexei Gilchrist,2, 5\n\nPrasanna Pakkiam,2, 3 Arkady Fedorov,2, 3 and Fabio Costa3, 6\n\n1School of Computer Science, University of Technology Sydney,\n\nUltimo, Sydney, New South Wales 2007, Australia\n\n2ARC Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems,\n\n3School of Maths and Physics, University of Queensland,\n\nSt. Lucia, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia\n\n4Fiasqo, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia\n\n5School of Mathemtical and Physical Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2122, Australia 6Nordita, Stockholm University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, 106 91, Sweden\n\n> Current quantum technologies are at the cusp of becoming useful, but still face formidable obstacles such as noise. Noise severely limits the ability to scale quantum devices to the point that they would offer an advantage over classical devices. To understand the sources of noise it is necessary to fully characterise the quantum processes occurring across many time steps; only this would reveal any time-correlated noise called non-Markovian. Previous efforts have attempted such a characterisation but obtained only a limited reconstruction of such multi-time processes. In this work, we fully characterise a multi-time quantum process on superconducting hardware using in-house and cloud-based quantum processors. We achieve this by employing sequential measure-and-prepare operations combined with post-processing. Employing a recently developed formalism for multitime processes, we detect general multi-time correlated noise. We also detect quantum correlated noise which demonstrates that part of the noise originates from quantum sources, such as physically nearby qubits on the chip. Our findings and techniques are expected to advance error-mitigation techniques in current quantum hardware, a necessary component to scale up the technology and achieve its true potential.\n\n#### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe characterisation of noise is a critical requirement for the advancement of quantum technologies. Noise is present in all current quantum devices as they interact with their environment; for many devices, this includes non-Markovian noise due to temporal correlations across a multi-time process. While most current techniques assume Markovian noise, this assumption fails in realistic quantum devices and non-Markovian noise has been reported in state-of-the-art quantum computing devices (such as IBM and Google) [1\u20133].\n\nPast general approaches to capture non-Markovian noise only provide access to two times of a quantum process through dynamical maps [4\u201310]. Beyond this, a number of techniques designed to reduce non-Markovian noise have been developed [11\u201315], and shown to increase computational accuracy [11], but all rely on ad-hoc methods, and a rigorous approach is still lacking.\n\nRecently, a formalism was developed that constructs a process matrix [16, 17], which encodes all multi-time correlations in a quantum process. In this formalism, non-Markovian noise is rigorously captured and can be further investigated in terms of its nature (quantum or classical) and amount [18, 19], as well as memory length and location in the device [20] with a prospect of scalability [21] and extending current characterisation methods to non-Markovian regimes [22]. The approach has been used in distinct experimental scenarios, successfully detecting non-Markovian noise [1, 20, 23\u201327].\n\nHowever, full reconstruction of a multi-time process matrix requires implementing sequential informationallycomplete operations, such as measure-and-prepare, on the system at every time step. Based on the assumption that this procedure requires mid-circuit measurements with a fast feed-forward of signal\u2014unavailable in current quantum computing platforms\u2014previous work did not succeed in performing full tomography but rather achieved a partial characterisation of non-Markovian noise, for example through a 'restricted' process matrix [27\u201330].\n\nHere, we present the first implementation of a rigorous and complete description of non-Markovian noise on quantum devices with superconducting qubits. We achieve this through full process tomography of a multitime quantum process and obtain measures of non-Markovianity. We implement mid-circuit measurements and overcome the need for a feed-forward mechanism with a post-processing trick. We use devices from the labs of the University of Queensland and the cloud capabilities of IBM Quantum [31]. We measure general and quantum non-Markovian noise in all cases and build a theoretical model to compare our findings. Our work offers a robust method for fully characterising non-Markovian noise, significantly advancing both our theo-\n\nSt. Lucia, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> These authors contributed equally to this work christina.giar@gmail.com tyler.jones@fiasqo.io\n\nretical understanding and the development of noise mitigation techniques.\nSource 5:\nAbstract:Quantum computers can exploit a Hilbert space whose dimension increases exponentially with the number of qubits. In experiment, quantum supremacy has recently been achieved by the Google team by using a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device with over 50 qubits. However, the question of what can be implemented on NISQ devices is still not fully explored, and discovering useful tasks for such devices is a topic of considerable interest. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are regarded as well-suited for execution on NISQ devices by combining quantum computers with classical computers, and are expected to be the first useful applications for quantum computing. Meanwhile, mitigation of errors on quantum processors is also crucial to obtain reliable results. In this article, we review the basic results for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and quantum error mitigation techniques. Since quantum computing with NISQ devices is an actively developing field, we expect this review to be a useful basis for future studies.\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?Learn more about arXivLabs.\narXiv Operational StatusGet status notifications viaemailorslack\nSource 6:\n# **Non-Markovian noise sources for quantum error mitigation**\n\nDoyeol Ahn1,2,* and Byeongyong Park1,3\n\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering,\n\n1\n\nUniversity of Seoul, 163 Seoulsiripdae-ro, Tongdaimoon-gu, Seoul 02504, Republic of Korea\n\n2 First Quantum, Inc, #210, 180 Bangbae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul 06586, Republic of Korea\n\n*Corresponding author: dahn@uos.ac.kr\n\n#### **ABSTRACT**\n\nReducing the impact of errors and decoherence in near-term quantum computers, such as noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, is critical for their practical implementation. These factors significantly limit the applicability of quantum algorithms, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of their physical origins to establish effective error mitigation strategies. In this study, we present a non-Markovian model of quantum state evolution and a quantum error mitigation cost function tailored for NISQ devices interacting with an environment represented by a set of simple harmonic oscillators as a noise source.\n\nEmploying the projection operator formalism and both advanced and retarded propagators in time, we derive the reduced-density operator for the output quantum states in a time-convolutionless form by solving the quantum Liouville equation. We examine the output quantum state fluctuations for both identity and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate operations in two-qubit operations using a range of input states. Subsequently, these results are compared with experimental data from ion-trap and superconducting quantum computing systems to estimate the crucial parameters of the cost functions for quantum error mitigation.\n\nOur findings reveal that the cost function for quantum error mitigation increases as the coupling strength between the quantum system and its environment intensifies. This study underscores the significance of non-Markovian models in understanding quantum state evolution and highlights the practical implications of the quantum error mitigation cost function when assessing experimental results from NISQ devices.\n\n#### **Introduction**\n\nInvestigating decoherence and gate errors as sources of noise is vital for understanding the underlying physical processes in quantum computing systems. These noise sources impose time and size constraints for practical applications [1]. Despite these limitations, shallow quantum circuits hold potential significance for solving practical problems through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms [2,3]. These hybrid systems can produce significant results that surpass classical computers, even with finite error rates, due to their error-resilience [4,5]. To maximize error suppression or mitigation while minimizing the number of qubits, it is essential to consider the high cost of full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing [6-8]. Noise arises from interactions between the qubit system and its environment, making it crucial to comprehend the physical basis of these errors for effective error mitigation strategy implementation.\n\nThe current Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) scheme necessitates information on noise parameters, system size, and circuit depth [6]. QEM methods often involve gate models to describe quantum circuits and time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics, incorporating the Lindblad operator as a noise source [6]. Descriptions of noise sources related to quantum state fluctuations can be derived from the kinetic perspective of non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics and are rooted in the quantum Liouville equation [9]. In many cases, conventional Langevin-type descriptions of these fluctuations result in memoryless noise sources, known as Markovian events [9].\n\nThe primary focus in studying noise sources affecting Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers has been on Markovian noise. However, it is crucial to examine the relationship between quantum error mitigation and non-Markovian noise sources, as these noise effects are practically unavoidable in most solid-state devices used for quantum computing. Markovian noise is characterized by memoryless behavior, while non-Markovian noise sources exhibit memory effects, where noise at any given moment depends on the system's past history [10-12]. Non-Markovian noise is more complicated to model and presents more demanding error mitigation challenges. In this study, we present a non-Markovian approach to analyze quantum state fluctuations in nearterm quantum computing devices, aiming to determine the Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) cost function. This approach is relevant as non-Markovian noise effects are common in these devices, and understanding their impact is essential for developing effective error mitigation strategies. Employing the non-Markovian approach and modeling the environment with simple harmonic oscillators allows us to investigate the relationship between noise sources and the quantum system's performance. This understanding is crucial for determining the QEM cost function, which quantifies the effectiveness of error reduction techniques applied to a quantum computing system. The insights gained from this non-Markovian approach can inform tailored quantum error mitigation strategies for near-term quantum computing devices. Addressing the unique challenges\n\n# **Non-Markovian noise sources for quantum error mitigation**\n\nposed by non-Markovian noise sources enables researchers to design more robust and efficient error mitigation techniques, leading to improved performance and reliability of these devices in the presence of various environmental disturbances.\n\nDissipation in quantum dynamics of a two-state or qubit system is widely encountered in physics and chemistry, and its description remains a significant theoretical challenge, especially when considering non-Markovian processes [10-13]. These non-Markovian processes related to dissipation are closely linked to the low-frequency noise spectrum [14-16]. It has been suggested that low-frequency noise plays a crucial role in decoherence processes in ion trap or superconducting systems for near-term quantum computers [3]. Understanding non-Markovian quantum dynamics of a two-state system is also important for evaluating the performance of an adiabatic quantum computer in the presence of noise [17]. This is because, for many difficult problems, the computation bottleneck involves passing through a point where the gap between the ground state and the first excited state is small, and the system is strongly coupled to the environment. One of the authors previously developed a time-convolutionless reduced-density operator theory of noisy quantum-state evolution [18, 19]. This time-convolutionless formulation was shown to incorporate both non-Markovian relaxation and memory effects [20]. The timeconvolutionless equations of motion were initially suggested by Tokuyama and Mori in the Heisenberg picture [21], and later developed in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture using the projection operator technique [22-23]. In this work, we extend the reduced-density operator theory to derive an expression for the quantum Liouville equation for a two-state system, making it more suitable for perturbational analysis to obtain the master equation in the presence of low-frequency noise and strong coupling to the environment.\n\nThis extended approach enables a comprehensive exploration of non-Markovian noise impacts on quantum computing device performance. By analyzing various noise sources' influence on system dynamics, researchers can pinpoint major error contributors and devise mitigation strategies. Moreover, understanding non-Markovian noise characteristics facilitates tailored error correction techniques addressing these sources' unique challenges. Studying non-Markovian noise sources and their quantum error mitigation relationship is crucial for quantum computing technology advancement. Utilizing a non-Markovian approach to assess quantum state fluctuations and addressing the distinct challenges of these noise sources allows for more effective error mitigation strategies, enhancing near-term quantum computing device performance and reliability. This work ultimately contributes to harnessing quantum computing power for numerous practical applications, including cryptography and materials science.\n\n### **Theoretical formulation**\n\nThe total Hamiltonian for an open two-state system is given by [12, 18,19, 25]\n\n$$\\widehat{H}_{T}=\\widehat{H}_{s}(t)+\\widehat{H}_{B}+\\widehat{H}_{int}\\tag{1}$$\n\nwhere is the system Hamiltonian for a two-state system, the Hamiltonian acting on the reservoir or an environment, is the interaction between the system and the environment (as depicted in figure 1).\n\nThe equation of motion for the total density operator of the total system is given by a quantum Liouville equation [18] \u03c1*T* (*t*)\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho_{\\,\\gamma}(t)=-i\\Big{[}\\widehat{H}_{\\,\\gamma}(t)\\,,\\rho_{\\,\\gamma}(t)\\,\\Big{]}=-i\\widehat{L}_{\\,\\gamma}(t)\\,\\rho_{\\,\\gamma}(t)\\,,\\tag{2}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\\widehat{L}_{T}(t)=\\widehat{L}_{S}(t)+\\widehat{L}_{B}(t)+\\widehat{L}_{int}(t)\\tag{3}$$\n\nis the Liouville super operator in one-to-one correspondence with the Hamiltonian.

In QAOA, the objective is a function of the quantum state, which itself is a function of the gate parameters of a multi-level parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). A classical optimizer varies the continuous gate parameters to generate distributions (quantum state) with significant support to the optimal solution. Even at the lowest circuit depth, QAOA offers non-trivial provable performance guarantee which is expected to increase with the circuit depth. However, the existing analysis fails to consider non-idealities in the qubit quality i.e., short lifetime and imperfect gate operations in realistic quantum hardware. In this article, we investigate the impact of various noise sources on the performance of QAOA both in simulation and on a real quantum computer from IBM. Our analyses indicate that the optimal number of stages (p-value) for any QAOA instance is limited by the noise characteristics (gate error, coherence time, etc.) of the target hardware as opposed to the current perception that higher-depth QAOA will provide monotonically better performance for a given problem compared to the low-depth implementations.\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?Learn more about arXivLabs.\narXiv Operational StatusGet status notifications viaemailorslack\nSource 9:\nShreyasi Mukherjee1 , Dario Penna2 , Fabio Cirinn`a2 , Mauro Paternostro3,4 , Elisabetta Paladino1,5,6 , Giuseppe Falci1,5,6 , and Luigi Giannelli1,5\n\n1 Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia \"Ettore Majorana\", Universit`a di Catania, Via S.

We investigate machine learning-based noise classification aimed at the recognition of the Markovian character of a dynamics and the identification of correlations of classical noise, as well as their interplay in small quantum networks. We operate control based on Coherent Tunneling by Adiabatic Passage (CTAP) or Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) in a three-level system using different pulse configurations as inputs to train a feedforward neural network. Our results show that supervised learning can classify distinct types of classical diagonal noise affecting the system. Three non-Markovian (quasistatic correlated, anti-correlated, and uncorrelated) and Markovian noise mechanisms are classified with 99% accuracy. Instead, correlations of Markovian noises cannot be classified with our method. The approach is robust against statistical measurement errors keeping its effectiveness even for physical measurements where a limited number of samples is available.\n\n#### 1. Introduction\n\nQuantum systems can nowadays be controlled with impressive accuracy [1] to perform new tasks leveraging their coherence properties, such as superposition and entanglement [2]. However, quantum behavior fades away because of environmental noise leading to loss of fidelity in quantum operations and decoherence [3\u20135]. Devising strategies to counteract these effects is thus paramount for advances in quantum technologies and in this context, machine learning (ML) emerges as an innovative and powerful diagnostic tool [6\u20138]. Approaches based on ML have been applied to various quantum control protocols [9\u201312], to quantum state tomography [13\u201315], to characterize quantum systems [16\u201318], to simulate open quantum systems [13, 18\u201320], to investigate non-Markovian dynamics [21, 22] and, in a spirit similar to this work, to characterize system-environment interactions [23, 24] and perform noise spectroscopy [25\u201327].\n\nMitigating decoherence effects is necessary to achieve quantum advantage. Several strategies have been developed in the last two decades both for quantum computation and in the broader perspective of quantum control. Error-avoidance (or passive stabilization) strategies consist of storing and processing information in suitably designed subspaces of the Hilbert space, which are protected from the interaction with the environment [28\u201330]. Examples of error-correcting (or active stabilization) strategies are Quantum Error Correction which relies on non-local information encoding [5, 31, 32], and Dynamical Decoupling [30, 33\u201335] consisting in repeated application of pulsed or switched control which has been used in solid-state coherent nanoscience to counteract 1/f noise [28, 36\u201338]. Specific strategies rely on the availability of information about the environment, whose characterization is thus a very important step towards the design of optimized systems and protocols. For individual qubits, this program has been carried out successfully in several platforms such as trapped ions [39, 40], photonic qubits [41], nuclear magnetic resonance [42, 43], and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond [44, 45]. Superconducting systems are the forefront examples in this context, with decoherence times that have improved from a few nanoseconds to milliseconds in about 15 years [46].\n\nOn the contrary, characterization of more complex systems such as multilevel nodes and multi-qubit architectures is still a challenge. In particular, the need of characterizing correlations between noises affecting different transition [47] or different nodes of the quantum architecture [48] is an emerging issue. A strong motivation of principle is that spatially correlated noise between physical qubits may spoil one of the pillars of digital quantum computation namely error correction in logical qubits, besides the fact that correlated errors are indeed observed in noisy intermediate-scale quantum structures [49]. Effects of spatially-correlated low-frequency noise between two quantum devices have been observed since several decades [50] and their impact on decoherence was investigated [48] since the first two-qubit superconducting gates were demonstrated. Recently, low-frequency noise correlations between pairs of qubits have been characterized by direct measurement of the noise power spectra [51\u201353]. However, the full characterization of noise acting on a controllable quantum system is a difficult task requiring exceedingly large resources as the systems scale up. In this work, we seek to pursue a different avenue passing through the classification of the multivariable noise acting on a quantum architecture. Our primary focus is to find a ML-based procedure that recognizes the presence of noise correlations. We will see that this possibility is intimately related to the (non-)Markovian character of the dynamics, and might thus be useful in the investigation of the effect that non-Markovianity has in the establishment of many-body phenomena [54, 55].\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Christiane P.

      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to simulate a complete Hamiltonian for braiding non-Abelian Fibonacci anyons in a fractional quantum Hall system. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Fibonacci anyons are a type of quasiparticle in topological quantum computing. They have a specific braiding structure and their fusion rules are based on the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibbonaci indices tell me there are two types: A and B, with each having certain fusion properties. This is important because it defines how they can fuse together when braid them.\n\nNext, fractional quantum Hall systems are in two dimensions (2D) at certain fillings where their conductance shows fractionally quantized values. The filling factor \u03bd determines the anyons' statistics; higher \u03bd means more abelian anyons but different braiding properties.\n\nSo, to simulate this in a FQH system, I think the setup would involve using electrons or perhaps quasiparticles that can move and interact. I should probably use an atom trap or something similar because they can manipulate individual particles with high precision.\n\nThe Hamiltonian itself is tricky. It needs to include terms for creating and annihilating anyons and their braiding interactions. Each anyon has its own creation operator, and when you braid them, the Hamiltonian adds energy proportional to some function of their quantum numbers, like their Fibonacci indices. This would prevent them from just freely moving; instead, they have a preferred way to move around each other.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact form of the Hamiltonian. It might involve terms that depend on the braiding statistics and the filling factor \u03bd. Maybe it's something like a sum over all pairs of anyons with some coupling term for their braidings, scaled by (something)\u03bd\u00b2 or similar.\n\nTopological protection is another big part. This refers to the system being robust against local perturbations, which is key for topological quantum computation. The threshold would be the minimum number of qubits needed such that any errors can't propagate beyond a certain distance before they're measured and corrected.\n\nI should also consider how exactly braiding affects the state. Braiding operations create non-trivial braided sectors in the Hilbert space, effectively protecting the system from decoherence because there's no way to easily measure it without disturbing the anyons.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the specifics of the Fibonacci anyon model and how they're implemented in a FQH system. Maybe I should look into specific models like the 2015 work by Gu et al., where they proposed using spin liquid models to represent anyons. That might be relevant.\n\nAlso, the calculation part is intimidating. How do you compute these Hamiltonians numerically? Perhaps there are well-known algorithms or approximations that have been developed for this purpose. I should check if there's a standard approach or method used in recent research on implementing braiding in FQH systems.\n\nI think I need to outline the steps: define the anyon basis, construct creation and annihilation operators, write down the braiding terms as Hamiltonian terms, model the FQH system with appropriate interactions, then compute observables that test topological protection by checking how much information is preserved under local perturbations.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure about the specifics of the Fibonacci anyons' braiding. Maybe it's more about their exchange statistics rather than their fusing properties? The fusion rules for Fibonacci are A\u2297A = B and A\u2297B = A, which means they can't fuse into a vacuum or another type without specific conditions.\n\nAlso, how does this relate to the fractional quantum Hall effect? The system has a filling factor \u03bd that's related to the anyons' charges. For Fibonacci anyons, I think \u03bd is at least 5/2, but higher fractions might correspond to more complex braiding patterns. Maybe for each Fibonacci index, you have certain fillings that are allowed.\n\nI'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to structure it:\n\n1. **Anyon Model**: Define the anyons with their fusion rules based on Fibonacci numbers. The anyons can be created and annihilated using creation and annihilation operators.\n\n2. **Braiding Terms**: Each time two anyons are braided, a term is added to the Hamiltonian proportional to (something)\u03bd\u00b2 times some function of their indices, enforcing that the anyons don't commute without being braid'ed.\n\n3. **FQH System Setup**: Place electrons in an FQH trap or simulate using other systems where their interactions can mimic the fractional statistics. Maybe use spinful particles for higher fillings.\n\n4. **Hamiltonian Construction**: Sum over all pairs of anyons, with each pair contributing a term based on their indices and \u03bd\u00b2, ensuring that braiding costs energy.\n\n5. **Observables and Topological Protection**: Use observables like the quantum exchange (like S-matrix elements) to detect anyons. The threshold for protection would be when these observables are robust against local errors, indicating that only global braiding information is preserved.\n\nI think I need to look into how exactly this has been implemented in simulations. Maybe recent studies have used ansatz Hamiltonians where the anyon operators are expressed in terms of spin degrees of freedom or using some sort of basis transformation.\n\nAlso, topological protection threshold for Fibonacci anyons might be known from theoretical works. If not, perhaps it's a function of \u03bd and their indices. For example, with higher \u03bd values, you need more qubits to achieve a certain protection level.\n\nBut honestly, I'm getting a bit stuck because I don't remember the exact mathematical expressions involved in these simulations. Maybe starting by looking up some papers on braiding anyons in FQH systems would give me a better grasp of how the Hamiltonian is structured.\n\nI should also consider whether there are any existing numerical studies that have implemented this before, which could provide guidance on how to proceed. If I can find someone who's worked on this topic, they might be able to give me some references or methodologies to follow.\n\nIn summary, simulating a complete Hamiltonian for Fibonacci anyon braiding in FQH systems involves defining the anyons with their fusion rules, creating and annihilating operators, adding braiding terms proportional to \u03bd\u00b2, setting up the system within an FQH trap, and then calculating observables. The topological protection threshold would depend on \u03bd and the indices of the Fibonacci anyons.\n\nI think I need to piece this together step by step, starting from defining the anyon model, moving through the Hamiltonian construction, simulating it numerically, and then analyzing the results for topological protection.\n</think>\n\nSimulating a complete Hamiltonian for braiding non-Abelian Fibonacci anyons in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) system involves several key steps, each building upon the others. Here's an organized approach to achieve this:\n\n### 1. **Anyon Model**\n   - **Fusion Rules**: Define the fusion rules based on the Fibonacci sequence: A\u2297A = B and A\u2297B = A. This determines how anyons can fuse or annihilate.\n   - **Anyon Basis**: Use operators (creation/annihilation) to represent each type of anyon, incorporating their quantum numbers as indices.\n\n### 2. **Braiding Terms**\n   - **Energy Cost**: Construct terms in the Hamiltonian that penalize braid operations, with energy proportional to functions involving \u03bd\u00b2 and Fibonacci indices.\n   - **Non-Commutative Algebra**: Ensure braiding introduces a preferred movement, preventing free motion without interaction.\n\n### 3. **FQH System Setup**\n   - **Implementation**: Use systems like electrons in an FQH trap or spin liquid models for higher fillings to mimic fractional statistics.\n   - **Interactions**: Simulate interactions where anyons move and interact, mimicking physical FQH interactions.\n\n### 4. **Hamiltonian Construction**\n   - **Pairwise Terms**: Sum over all pairs of anyons with terms proportional to \u03bd\u00b2 and Fibonacci indices.\n   - **Braiding Operators**: Represent braid operations through operator products, adding Hamiltonian elements for each pair.\n\n### 5. **Observables and Topological Protection**\n   - **Quantum Exchange**: Use observables like S-matrix to detect anyon exchange, revealing non-trivial braiding information.\n   - **Protection Threshold**: Determine the minimum qubits needed to maintain topological protection by evaluating robustness against local errors.\n\n### 6. **Numerical Simulations**\n   - **Implementation**: Apply ansatz Hamiltonians and compute observables to test braiding effects.\n   - **Threshold Calculation**: Estimate the threshold for maintaining topological protection based on \u03bd and Fibonacci indices.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis approach involves defining anyons, constructing a braid-heavy Hamiltonian, setting up an FQH system, and using numerical methods to assess topological protection. Theoretical work could guide simulations, which are crucial for understanding braiding in FQH systems and their potential applications in quantum computing."

      "response_tokens": 1581,
      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to understand this paper about Majorana zero modes and non-Abelian braiding in quantum-dot-superconductor arrays. Let me start by breaking down the key concepts from the introduction.\n\nFirst, the exchange statistics of particles\u2014focusing on identical particles like electrons and photons\u2014in lower dimensions. Electrons are fermions with spin 1/2, while photons have spin 1. Exchanging their positions leads to different wavefunction transformations in degenerate ground states, which is a big deal for understanding non-Abelian anyons.\n\nMajorana zero modes are a type of non-Abelian anyon. They're like Ising anyons, which have a simple exchange statistics of exchanging two Majoranas gives you another Majorana. The proposal here uses quantum dots and superconductors to get these Majorana zero modes. This is promising for topological quantum computation because it's protected by the topological nature.\n\nThe paper mentions something about Kitaev chains and Majorana pairs. A Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional model with strong spin-orbit coupling, which can host Majorana fermions at defects. So arranging these in a qubit system would be great for quantum computing. But this paper talks about using multiple qubits (quantum dots) to create Majorana zero modes.\n\nThe minimal braid protocol they're talking about is where you exchange two anyons, and depending on the order of exchange, different transformations happen. The idea is that such braiding can encode information, like qubits. But in reality, this requires moving Majoranas from one location to another, which might be tricky.\n\nNow, the paper points out that both Coulomb repulsion between dots and single-electron tunneling can cause errors in these operations. Coulomb repulsion is a big deal because it's an attractive interaction when particles are close\u2014wait, no, wait. Actually, interdot Coulomb repulsion can lead to frustration if the system isn't tuned properly. But the paper says that this interdot interaction can be detrimental, especially with strong interactions within Kitaev chains.\n\nResidual single-electron tunneling is another issue because it's like electron scattering in a normal conductor. That would mess up the Majorana modes and ruin the braiding operations. So these two factors are causing problems for experiments aiming to do non-Abelian exchange statistics.\n\nBut here's where they say the paper suggests a way around. They propose using an ancillary quantum dot as a mediator during the braid operation. Since theancillary system is normal, it can mediate the exchange without directly interacting with the Majorana modes, which are at the dots. So by controlling this intermediary, maybe you can counteract these errors.\n\nThey also mention methods to find this optimal regime where the interaction between the main qubits (dots) and the ancillary is just right. If not controlled correctly, the interactions could cause issues\u2014like making the Majorana modes have wrong statistics or losing their protection. So finding the sweet spot where everything works smoothly would be key.\n\nThe paper also talks about predicting signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment. Maybe they can see if the anyons are exchanging properly and maintaining their properties, like their topological nature. That would indicate that the protocol worked successfully.\n\nI'm a bit confused about how exactly this braid operation is being done with quantum dots. It's not just simple exchange of particles; it involves moving them through an intermediate system. So maybe the anyons are being moved from one end of the chain to another, and during this movement, some errors accumulate? The ancillary dot must help in stabilizing these operations.\n\nAlso, I'm thinking about how this is different from other setups where you have just two quantum dots connected by a superconductor. In that case, maybe the Majorana modes are localized, but here with an ancillary system, perhaps they can be more robust?\n\nI wonder what methods they're using to measure these errors and find the optimal control. Maybe through measurements on the ancillary dot's states or some kind of parity measurements? If you can tune the couplings properly between the main dots and the ancillary one, you might be able to mitigate both Coulomb repulsion and single-electron tunneling.\n\nThe paper also mentions that without topological protection, Majorana zero modes aren't stable. So the ancillary system needs to somehow maintain the Majorana properties during the exchange. That makes sense because if everything is in a normal quantum dot, you don't have any inherent protection\u2014so you need an intermediary to mediate the exchange without directly interacting with the topological states.\n\nIn summary, the key points I'm digesting are:\n1. The paper generalizes braid protocols for Kitaev chains using quantum dots as both qubits and hosts of Majorana zero modes.\n2. It faces issues due to Coulomb repulsion and single-electron tunneling.\n3. Using an intermediary system (ancillary dot) allows them to mitigate these errors.\n4. They propose a way to find the optimal control parameters for this intermediary, ensuring the braiding works smoothly.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how exactly they measure the error or compute the optimal conditions, but it seems like a multi-step process involving adjustments to the coupling strengths and monitoring the outcomes of their operations.

      "context": "Source 1:\n# Braiding statistics\n\nThe topological order realized above supports a coveted type of quasiparticle\u2014the Fibonacci anyons\u2014whose braiding statistics can give rise to universal topological quantum computation [1]. To demonstrate the nontrivial braiding statistics of Fibonacci anyons, we create two pairs of them from the vacuum living on two plaquettes, as illustrated in Fig. 4a. We then braid them following different sequences by the corresponding string operators. After braiding, we fuse them pairwise and measure the fusion outcomes to detect their braiding statistics. We encode a logical qubit into four Fibonacci anyons as |\u00af0\u27e9 = |(\u03c4 \u00d7 \u03c4 )1 ,(\u03c4 \u00d7 \u03c4 )1 \u27e9 and |\u00af1\u27e9 = |(\u03c4 \u00d7 \u03c4 ) \u03c4 ,(\u03c4 \u00d7 \u03c4 ) \u03c4 \u27e9, and denote the braiding operations of the first and middle two anyons as \u03c31 and \u03c32, respectively (Fig. 4b). We note that \u03c31 and \u03c32 are unitary logical gates and their matrix representation can be calculated by the Fand R-moves (Methods and Supplementary Information I.B).\n\nStarting with the prepared ground state, we create two pairs of Fibonacci anyons labeled as \u03c41,2,3,4 by acting a short type-1 open string. In the logical space, we initialize the system into the state |\u00af0\u27e9. We consider five different braiding sequences shown in Fig. 4c and plot the corresponding measured fusion results in Fig. 4d: (i) without braiding. As shown in Fig. 4d(i), we measure a probability of 0.81 and 0.04 for both pairs fusing to 1 and \u03c4 respectively, which confirms the theoretical prediction that anyons created in pairs from vacuum will annihilate back into vacuum without braiding; (ii) braiding of the middle two Fibonacci anyons once. This will change the fusion output for both pairs, resulting in a superposition state in the logical space as \u03c32 |\u00af0\u27e9 = \u03d5 \u22121 e 4\u03c0i/5 |\u00af0\u27e9 + \u03d5 \u22121/2 e \u22123\u03c0i/5 |\u00af1\u27e9. In our experiment, the measured probabilities of the two pairs after braiding fusing to 1 and \u03c4 are 0.32 and 0.56, respectively. This agrees with the theoretical prediction and verifies the non-Abelian fusion rule in Eq. (2); (iiiiv) preparation and verification of a logical eigenstate of \u03c32 through braidings. From the Yang-Baxter equation [53, 54], \u03c31\u03c32|\u00af0\u27e9 is an eigenstate of \u03c32. This is verified by our experimental result that the difference between the fusion results before and after implementing an additional \u03c32 on \u03c31\u03c32|\u00af0\u27e9 is insignificant, as manifested in Fig. 4d (iii) and (iv); (v) braiding of the middle two Fibonacci anyons twice, which provides information about the monodromy matrix M that characterizes the mutual statistics of Fibonacci anyons from the perspective of modular tensor category theory [7]. The elements of M can be written in the form of logical observable as M\u03c4 \u03c4 = \u27e8\u00af0| \u03c32\u03c32 |\u00af0\u27e9, where M11, M1\u03c4 , and M\u03c41 equal 1 since the braiding with the vacuum 1 does not change the fusion results. From the experimental result shown in Fig. 4d(v), we obtain that M\u03c4 \u03c4 = \u22120.39, which agrees well with the theoretical value of \u22121/\u03d52 \u2248 \u22120.38. The measured quantum dimension of the Fibonacci anyon is \u03d5exp = 1.60, very close to the ideal value d\u03c4 = \u03d5 \u2248 1.618. This gives a piece of clear evidence that the quasiparticle excitations we created in the experiment are indeed Fibonacci anyons.\n\nWe mention that the braidings carried out in our experiment involve no Hamiltonian dynamics of quasiparticle excitations. As a result, they are not endowed with topological protection that naturally arises from an energy gap separating the many-body degenerate ground states from the lowlying excited states. This is distinct from conventional protocols for braiding anyons [1] and therefore our experiment is more of a quantum simulation of braiding Fibonacci anyons in this sense. This explains as well the evident small deviations between the experimentally measured fusion results after braidings and the ideal theoretical predictions. Without topological protection, inevitable experimental imperfections including gate errors and limited coherence time would cause a sizable infidelity for the final states after braidings. To leverage the Fibonacci anyons in our experiment for topologically protected quantum computing, an active error correction procedure such as the Fibonacci Turaev-Viro code [55] must be enforced during the braiding process. We leave this interesting and important topic for future study.\nSource 2:\n# Braiding Fibonacci anyons\n\n#### Ludmil Hadjiivanov and Lachezar S.

Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group Bn acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons.

The limitation of quantum data vulnerability by fundamental physical principles is therefore highly welcomed. Such theoretical possibility is provided by Topological Quantum Computation (TQC) (cf. e.g. the recent textbook [1]). An experimentally promising setting of this type in which quantum information processing is protected from noise and decoherence by the topological properties of the quantum system is based on braiding of non-Abelian anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in certain fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. We will focus in what follows on the Fibonacci anyons realized as the \u03b5 field in the Z3 parafermion FQH state in the second Landau level with filling factor 12 5 . This construction is introduced and discussed in details in the parallel paper [2] where the reader could find as well an extensive list of literature on the subject.\n\nThe aim of present article is to provide a description of the monodromy representation of the braid group Bn (see e.g. [3] and the references therein) realized on the set of chiral conformal blocks of n Fibonacci anyons \u03b5 and 3 r electrons. To this end we will follow the Ardonne and Schoutens' approach [4] which we will generalize in two different directions. While [4] only covers the case of four (n = 4 ) \u03b5 fields and no electrons (r = 0 ), we will consider also arbitrary r case and then the most general case thus opening a theoretical perspective to constructing N qubit quantum registers.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Steven H.

For all elementary and quasiparticles observed to date\u2014including fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons\u2014this principle guarantees that the braiding of identical particles leaves the system unchanged2,3. However, in two spatial dimensions, an intriguing possibility exists: braiding of non-Abelian anyons causes rotations in a space of topologically degenerate wavefunctions4,5,6,7,8. Hence, it can change the observables of the system without violating the principle of indistinguishability. Despite the well-developed mathematical description of non-Abelian anyons and numerous theoretical proposals9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22, the experimental observation of their exchange statistics has remained elusive for decades. Controllable many-body quantum states generated on quantum processors offer another path for exploring these fundamental phenomena. Whereas efforts on conventional solid-state platforms typically involve Hamiltonian dynamics of quasiparticles, superconducting quantum processors allow for directly manipulating the many-body wavefunction by means of unitary gates. Building on predictions that stabilizer codes can host projective non-Abelian Ising anyons9,10, we implement a generalized stabilizer code and unitary protocol23to create and braid them. This allows us to experimentally verify the fusion rules of the anyons and braid them to realize their statistics. We then study the prospect of using the anyons for quantum computation and use braiding to create an entangled state of anyons encoding three logical qubits. Our work provides new insights about non-Abelian braiding and, through the future inclusion of error correction to achieve topological protection, could open a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computing.\nElementary particles in three dimensions are either bosons or fermions. The existence of only two types is rooted in the fact that the worldlines of two particles in three plus one dimensions can always be untied in a trivial manner. Hence, exchanging a pair of indistinguishable particles twice is topologically equivalent to not exchanging them at all, and the wavefunction must remain the same. Representing the exchange as a matrixRacting on the space of wavefunctions with a constant number of particles, it is thus required thatR2= 1 (a scalar), leaving two possibilities:R= 1 (bosons) andR= \u22121 (fermions). Such continuous deformation is not possible in two dimensions, thus allowing collective excitations (quasiparticles) to show richer braiding behaviour. In particular, this permits the existence of Abelian anyons2,3,6,7,8,24,25, in which the global phase change due to braiding can take any value. It has been proposed that there exists another class of quasiparticles known as non-Abelian anyons, in which braiding instead results in a change of the observables of the wavefunction4,5,24. In other words,R2does not simplify to a scalar, but remains a unitary matrix. Therefore,R2is a fundamental characteristic of anyon braiding. The topological approach to quantum computation26aims to leverage these non-Abelian anyons and their topological nature to enable gate operations that are protected against local perturbations and decoherence errors5,27,28,29,30. In solid-state systems, primary candidates of non-Abelian quasiparticles are low-energy excitations in Hamiltonian systems, including the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall states31,32, vortices in topological superconductors33,34and Majorana zero modes in semiconductors proximitized by superconductors35,36,37,38. However, direct verification of non-Abelian exchange statistics has remained elusive39,40,41.\nIn the graph framework introduced above, it has been shown that such dislocations are characterized as vertices of degree 2 and 3 (ref.23). Consider the stabilizer graph of the surface code26,44, specifically with boundary conditions such that the degeneracy is two. Although all the vertices in the bulk are D4Vs, one can create two D3Vs by removing an edge between two neighbouring plaquettespandq, and introducing the new stabilizer\\(\\hat{S}={\\hat{S}}_{p}{\\hat{S}}_{q}\\)(Fig.1b). Evidently, the introduction of two D3Vs reduces the number of independent stabilizers by one and thus doubles the degeneracy. This doubling is exactly what is expected when a pair of Ising anyons is introduced9,10; hence, D3Vs appear as a candidate of non-Abelian anyons, and we will denote them as\u03c3.\nTo be braided and fused by unitary operations, the D3Vs must be moved. Whereas the structure of the stabilizer graph is usually considered to be static, it was predicted by Bombin that the dislocations in the surface code would show projective non-Abelian Ising statistics if braided10. Here, we will use a specific protocol recently proposed by Lensky et al.23for deforming the stabilizer graph (and thus moving the anyons) using local two-qubit Clifford gates. To shift a D3V from vertexutov, an edge must be disconnected fromvand reconnected tou. This can be achieved by means of the gate unitary\\(\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{8}[{\\hat{S}}_{p}^{{\\prime} },{\\hat{S}}_{p}]\\right)\\), where\\({\\hat{S}}_{p}\\)is the original stabilizer containing the edge andu, and\\({\\hat{S}}_{p}^{{\\prime} }\\)is the new stabilizer that emerges after moving the edge23. In cases where the D3V is shifted between two connected vertices, the unitary simplifies to the form\\({U}_{\\pm }({\\hat{\\tau }}_{u}{\\hat{\\tau }}_{v})\\equiv \\exp \\left(\\pm i\\frac{\\pi }{4}{\\hat{\\tau }}_{u}{\\hat{\\tau }}_{v}\\right)\\), where\\({\\hat{\\tau }}_{u}\\)and\\({\\hat{\\tau }}_{v}\\)are Pauli operators acting on verticesuandv. We experimentally realize this unitary through a controlled Z (CZ) gate and single-qubit rotations (median errors of 7.3 \u00d7 10\u22123and 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123, respectively;Methods).\nFollowing these insights from Kitaev and Bombin, we now turn to our experimental study of the proposed anyons, using the protocol described in ref.23. In the first experiment, we demonstrate the creation of anyons and the fundamental fusion rules of\u03c3and\u03b5(Fig.2a). In a 5 \u00d7 5 grid of superconducting qubits, we first use a protocol consisting of four layers of CZ gates to prepare the surface code ground state (Fig.2b(i), see also ref.43). The average stabilizer value after the ground state preparation is 0.94 \u00b1 0.04 (individual stabilizer values shown in Extended Data Fig.3c). We then remove a stabilizer edge to create a pair of D3Vs (\u03c3) and separate them through the application of two-qubit gates. Fig.2b(i)\u2013(iv)show the measured stabilizer values in the resultant graph in each step of this procedure (determined by simultaneously measuring the involved qubits in their respective bases,n= 10,000; note that the measurements are destructive and the protocol is restarted after each measurement). In Fig.2b(v), single-qubit Z gates are applied to two qubits near the lower left corner of the grid to create adjacent plaquette violations, which together form a fermion. Through the sequential application of X and Z gates (Fig.2b(vii)\u2013(viii)), one of the plaquette violations is then made to encircle the right\u03c3vertex. Crucially, after moving around\u03c3, the plaquette violation does not return to where it started, but rather to the location of the other plaquette violation. This enables them to annihilate (Fig.2b(viii)), causing the fermion to seemingly disappear. However, by bringing the two\u03c3back together and annihilating them (Fig.2b(ix)\u2013(xi)), we arrive at a striking observation: an\u03b5particle re-emerges on two of the square plaquettes where the\u03c3vertices previously resided.\na, The braiding worldlines used to fuse\u03b5and\u03c3.b, Expectation values of stabilizers at each step of the unitary operation after readout correction (see Extended Data Fig.3for details and individual stabilizer values). We first prepare the ground state of the surface code (step (i); average stabilizer value of 0.94 \u00b1 0.04, where the uncertainty is one standard deviation). A D3V (\u03c3) pair is then created (ii) and separated (iii)\u2013(iv), before creating a fermion,\u03b5(v). One of the plaquette violations is brought around the right\u03c3(vi)\u2013(viii), allowing it to annihilate with the other plaquette violation (viii). The fermion has seemingly disappeared, but re-emerges when the\u03c3are annihilated ((xi); stabilizer values \u22120.86 and \u22120.87). The path (v) \u2192 (viii) demonstrates the fusion rule,\u03c3\u00d7\u03b5=\u03c3. The different fermion parities at the end of the paths (viii) \u2192 (xi) and (iv) \u2192 (i) show the other fusion rule,\\(\\sigma \\times \\sigma ={\\mathbb{1}}+\\varepsilon \\). Yellow triangles represent the positions of the\u03c3. The brown and red lines denote the paths of the\u03c3and the plaquette violation, respectively. Red squares (diamonds) represent X (Z) gates. Upper left shows a table of two-qubit unitaries used in the protocol. Each stabilizer was measuredn= 10,000 times in each step.c, A non-local technique for hidden fermion detection: the presence of a fermion in a\u03c3-pair can be deduced by measuring the sign of the Pauli string\\(\\hat{{\\mathcal{P}}}\\)corresponding to bringing a plaquette violation around the\u03c3-pair (grey path).\\(\\hat{{\\mathcal{P}}}\\)is equivalent to the shorter string\\(\\hat{{{\\mathcal{P}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\)(black path). Measurements of\\(\\hat{{{\\mathcal{P}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\)in steps (viii) (top) and (iv) (bottom) give values of \u22120.85 \u00b1 0.01 and +0.84 \u00b1 0.01, respectively. This indicates that there is a hidden fermion pair in the former case, but not in the latter, despite the stabilizers being the same.\nOur results demonstrate the fusion of\u03b5and\u03c3. The disappearance of the fermion from step (v) to (viii) establishes the fundamental fusion rule of\u03b5and\u03c3:\nWe emphasize that none of the single-qubit gates along the path of the plaquette violation are applied to the qubits hosting the mobile\u03c3; our observations are therefore solely due to the non-local effects of non-Abelian D3Vs, and exemplify the unconventional behaviour of the latter. Moreover, another fusion rule is seen by considering the reverse path (iv) \u2192 (i), and comparing it to the path (viii) \u2192 (xi). These two paths demonstrate that a pair of\u03c3can fuse to form either vacuum (\\({\\mathbb{1}}\\)) or one fermion (steps (i) and (xi), respectively):\nThe starting points of these two paths ((iv) and (viii)) cannot be distinguished by any local measurement. We therefore introduce a non-local measurement technique that allows for detecting an\u03b5without fusing the\u03c3(refs.10,23,26). The key idea underlying this method is that bringing a plaquette violation around a fermion should result in a\u03c0phase. We therefore measure the Pauli string\\(\\hat{{\\mathcal{P}}}\\)that corresponds to creating two plaquette violations, bringing one of them around the two\u03c3, and finally annihilating them with each other (grey paths in Fig.2c). The existence of an\u03b5inside the\u03c3-pair should cause\\(\\langle \\hat{{\\mathcal{P}}}\\rangle =-1\\). To simplify this technique further,\\(\\hat{{\\mathcal{P}}}\\)can be reduced to a shorter string\\(\\hat{{{\\mathcal{P}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\)(black paths in Fig.2c) by taking advantage of the stabilizers it encompasses. For instance, if\\(\\hat{{\\mathcal{P}}}\\)contains three of the operators in a four-qubit stabilizer, these can be switched out with the remaining operator. Measuring\\(\\langle \\hat{{{\\mathcal{P}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\rangle \\)in step (iv), in which the\u03c3are separated but the fermion has not yet been introduced, gives\\(\\langle \\hat{{{\\mathcal{P}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\rangle =+\\,0.84\\pm 0.01\\), consistent with the absence of fermions (Fig.2c). However, performing the exact same measurement in step(viii), in which the\u03c3are in the same positions, we find\\(\\langle \\hat{{{\\mathcal{P}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\rangle =-\\,0.85\\pm 0.01\\), indicating that an\u03b5is delocalized across the spatially separated\u03c3pair (Fig.2c). This observation highlights the non-local encoding of the fermions, which cannot be explained with classical physics.\nHaving demonstrated the above fusion rules involving\u03c3, we next braid them with each other to directly show their non-Abelian statistics. We consider two spatially separated\u03c3pairs, A and B, by removing two stabilizer edges (Fig.3a,b(ii)). Next, we apply two-qubit gates along a horizontal path to separate the\u03c3in pair A (Fig.3b(iii)), followed by a similar procedure in the vertical direction on pair B (Fig.3b(iv)), so that one of its\u03c3crosses the path of pair A. We then subsequently bring the\u03c3from pairs A and B back to their original positions (Fig.3b(v)\u2013(viii)and(ix)\u2013(xi), respectively). When the two\u03c3pairs are annihilated in the final step (Fig.3b(xii)), we observe that a fermion is revealed in each of the positions where the\u03c3pairs resided (average stabilizer value \u22120.45 \u00b1 0.06). This shows a clear change in local observables from the initial state in which no fermions were present. As a control experiment, we repeat the experiment with distinguishable\u03c3pairs, achieved by attaching a plaquette violation to each of the\u03c3in pair B (Fig.3c,d; see also Extended Data Fig.8for stabilizer measurements through the full protocol). Moving the plaquette violation along with the\u03c3requires a string of single-qubit gates, which switches the direction of the rotation in the multiqubit unitaries,U\u00b1\u2192U\u2213. In this case, no fermions are observed at the end of the protocol (average stabilizer value +0.46 \u00b1 0.04), thus providing a successful control.\nSource 4:\n# Non-Abelian Anyons and Non-Abelian Vortices in Topological Superconductors\n\nYusuke Masaki*a,b* , Takeshi Mizushima*c*,\u2217 and Muneto Nitta*b,d,e*,\u2217\n\n*aDepartment of Physics, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8578, Japan*\n\n*bResearch and Education Center for Natural Sciences, Keio University, Hiyoshi 4-1-1, Yokohama, Kanagawa 223-8521, Japan*\n\n*cDepartment of Materials Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-8531, Japan*\n\n*dDepartment of Physics, Keio University, Hiyoshi 4-1-1, Japan*\n\n*e International Institute for Sustainability with Knotted Chiral Meta Matter (SKCM*2 *), Hiroshima University, Kagamiyama 1-3-2, Higashi-Hiroshima, Hiroshima 739-8511, Japan*\n\n# A R T I C L E I N F O\n\n#### *Keywords*:\n\nNon-Abelian vortices, non-Abelian anyons, non-Abelian statistics, topological quantum computation, topological materials, topological superconductors, topological superfluids, superfluid 3He, spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, nematic liquid crystals, chiral liquid crystals, quark matter, nuclear matter, nuclear superfluids\n\n## A B S T R A C T\n\nAnyons are particles obeying statistics of neither bosons nor fermions. Non-Abelian anyons, whose exchanges are described by a non-Abelian group acting on a set of wave functions, are attracting a great attention because of possible applications to topological quantum computations. Braiding of non-Abelian anyons corresponds to quantum computations. The simplest non-Abelian anyons are Ising anyons which can be realized by Majorana fermions hosted by vortices or edges of topological superconductors, = 5\u22152 quantum Hall states, spin liquids, and dense quark matter. While Ising anyons are insufficient for universal quantum computations, Fibonacci anyons present in = 12\u22155 quantum Hall states can be used for universal quantum computations. Yang-Lee anyons are nonunitary counterparts of Fibonacci anyons. Another possibility of non-Abelian anyons (of bosonic origin) is given by vortex anyons, which are constructed from non-Abelian vortices supported by a non-Abelian first homotopy group, relevant for certain nematic liquid crystals, superfluid 3He, spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, and high density quark matter. Finally, there is a unique system admitting two types of non-Abelian anyons, Majorana fermions (Ising anyons) and non-Abelian vortex anyons.

Introduction**\n\nIn three spatial dimensions, all particles are either bosons or fermions in quantum physics, that is, a wave function of multi-particle states is symmetric (antisymmetric) under the exchanges of two bosons (fermions). On contrary, in two spatial dimensions, there exist exotic particles classified to neither bosons nor fermions, *anyons*. A wave function of two anyons receives a nontrivial phase factor under their exchanges Leinaas & Myrheim (1977), Wilczek (1982). Such exotic particles play essential roles in fractional quantum Hall states Halperin (1984), Arovas et al. (1984), and have been experimentally observed for = 1\u22153 fractional quantum Hall states Bartolomei et al. (2020), Nakamura et al. (2020).\n\nRecently, yet exotic particles attracted great attention, that is, *non-Abelian anyons*. Non-Abelian anyons are described by a set of multiple wave functions, and the exchanges of two non-Abelian anyons lead to unitary matrix operations on a set of wave functions. They have been theoretically predicted to exist in = 5\u22152 fractional quantum Hall states Moore & Read (1991), Nayak & Wilczek (1996), topological superconductors (SCs) and superfluids (SFs) Read & Green (2000), Ivanov (2001), Kitaev (2001), and spin liquids Kitaev (2006), Motome & Nasu (2020), and experimental observation is pursued. Non-Abelian anyons are attracting significant interests owing to the possibility to offer a platform of topologically protected quantum computations realized by braiding of non-Abelian anyons Kitaev (2003), Kitaev & Laumann (2008), Nayak\n\nmizushima@mp.es.osaka-u.ac.jp (T.

(2008), Pachos (2012), Sarma et al. (2015), Field & Simula (2018). Since the Hilbert space and braiding operations are topologically protected, they are robust against noises in contrast to the conventional quantum computation methods. Recently, it has been reported that non-Abelian braiding and fusions has been experimentally realised in a superconducting quantum processor, where the fusion and braiding protocols are implemented using a quantum circuit on a superconducting quantum processor Andersen et al. (2022), thereby opening a significant step to realize topological quantum computations.\n\nOne of the main routes to realize non-Abelian anyons is based on Majorana fermions in topological SCs Ivanov (2001), Kitaev (2001), Alicea (2012), Leijnse & Flensberg (2012), Beenakker (2013), Silaev & Volovik (2014), Elliott & Franz (2015), Sato & Fujimoto (2016), Mizushima et al. (2016), Sato & Ando (2017), Beenakker (2020), Marra (2022). Majorana fermions were originally proposed in high energy physics to explain neutrinos; they are particles that coincide with their own anti-particles Majorana (1937). In condensed matter physics, Majorana fermions are localized at vortices or edge of materials for which several protocols of non-Abelian braiding were proposed. Non-Abelian anyons constructed from Majorana fermions are so-called Ising anyons. They are not enough for universal quantum computations, and thus some non-topological process should be included Nayak et al. (2008). In contrast, another type of anyons called Fibonacci anyons Trebst et al. (2008) can offer a promising platform for universal topological quantum computation that all quantum gates are implemented by braiding manipulation in a topologically protected way Preskill (2004), Bonesteel et al. (2005), Hormozi et al. (2007). Such Fibonacci anyons are proposed to exist in = 12\u22155 quantum Hall states, a junction made of a conventional SC and a = 2\u22153 fractional quantum Hall state Mong et al. (2014), interacting Majorana fermions realized in a septuple-layer structure of topological SCs Hu & Kane (2018), and Rydberg atoms in a lattice Lesanovsky & Katsura (2012). Yang-Lee anyons are also proposed as non-unitary counterparts of Fibonacci anyons, obeying nonunitary non-Abelian statistics Ardonne et al. (2011), Freedman et al. (2012), Sanno et al. (2022).\nSource 5:\nIn physics, anyons are quasiparticles unique to two-dimensional systems, exhibiting properties distinct from standard elementary particles like fermions and bosons. When two identical anyons swap places, their wavefunctions can change in ways not possible in three dimensions, a phenomenon termed \"braiding.\" Anyons are classified as abelian or non-abelian, with abelian anyons linked to the fractional quantum Hall effect. Non-abelian anyons, though not definitively detected, are of interest for potential use in topological quantum computing, where their braiding could encode information more robustly. Microsoft has invested in anyon research for this purpose. The statistical mechanics of anyons reveals a range of behaviors between fermions and bosons, governed by a phase factor that can take any value, unlike the binary phase factors of fermions and bosons. Experiments in 2020 provided evidence for abelian anyons, while non-abelian anyons remain a topic of active research. The fusion of anyons can create composite particles with unique statistical properties, offering potential for quantum computation.\n\nThe chunk is: A group of theoretical physicists working at the University of Oslo, led by Jon Leinaas and Jan Myrheim, calculated in 1977 that the traditional division between fermions and bosons would not apply to theoretical particles existing in two dimensions. Such particles would be expected to exhibit a diverse range of previously unexpected properties. In 1982, Frank Wilczek published in two papers, exploring the fractional statistics of quasiparticles in two dimensions, giving them the name \"anyons.\"\n\nDaniel Tsui and Horst St\u00f6rmer discovered the fractional quantum Hall effect in 1982. The mathematics developed by Wilczek proved to be useful to Bertrand Halperin at Harvard University in explaining aspects of it. Frank Wilczek, Dan Arovas, and Robert Schrieffer verified this statement in 1985 with an explicit calculation that predicted that particles existing in these systems are in fact anyons.\n\nIn 2020, two teams of scientists (one in Paris, the other at Purdue) announced new experimental evidence for the existence of anyons. Both experiments were featured in Discover Magazines 2020 annual \"state of science\" issue.\n\nIn April, 2020, researchers from the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris) and the Centre for Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies (C2N) reported results from a tiny \"particle collider\" for anyons. They detected properties that matched predictions by theory for anyons.\n\nIn July, 2020, scientists at Purdue University detected anyons using a different setup.  The team's interferometer routes the electrons through a specific maze-like etched nanostructure made of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide. \"In the case of our anyons the phase generated by braiding was 2\u03c0/3,\" he said. \"That's different than what's been seen in nature before.\"\n\nNon-abelian anyons\n\nIn 1988, J\u00fcrg Fr\u00f6hlich showed that it was valid under the spin\u2013statistics theorem for the particle exchange to be monoidal (non-abelian statistics). In particular, this can be achieved when the system exhibits some degeneracy, so that multiple distinct states of the system have the same configuration of particles.  Then an exchange of particles can contribute not just a phase change, but can send the system into a different state with the same particle configuration.  Particle exchange then corresponds to a linear transformation on this subspace of degenerate states.  When there is no degeneracy, this subspace is one-dimensional and so all such linear transformations commute (because they are just multiplications by a phase factor).  When there is degeneracy and this subspace has higher dimension, then these linear transformations need not commute (just as matrix multiplication does not).\n\nGregory Moore, Nicholas Read, and Xiao-Gang Wen pointed out that non-Abelian statistics can be realized in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). While at first non-abelian anyons were generally considered a mathematical curiosity, physicists began pushing toward their discovery when Alexei Kitaev showed that non-abelian anyons could be used to construct a topological quantum computer.  As of 2012, no experiment has conclusively demonstrated the existence of non-abelian anyons although promising hints are emerging in the study of the \u03bd\u00a0=\u00a05/2 FQHE state. Experimental evidence of non-abelian anyons, although not yet conclusive and currently contested, was presented in October, 2013.\n\nFusion of anyons\n\nIn much the same way that two fermions (e.g. both of spin 1/2) can be looked at together as a composite boson (with total spin in a superposition of 0 and 1), two or more anyons together make up a composite anyon (possibly a boson or fermion). The composite anyon is said to be the result of the fusion of its components.\n\nIf  identical abelian anyons each with individual statistics  (that is, the system picks up a phase  when two individual anyons undergo adiabatic counterclockwise exchange) all fuse together, they together have statistics . This can be seen by noting that upon counterclockwise rotation of two composite anyons about each other, there are  pairs of individual anyons (one in the first composite anyon, one in the second composite anyon) that each contribute a phase . An analogous analysis applies to the fusion of non-identical abelian anyons. The statistics of the composite anyon is uniquely determined by the statistics of its components.\n\nNon-abelian anyons have more complicated fusion relations. As a rule, in a system with non-abelian anyons, there is a composite particle whose statistics label is not uniquely determined by the statistics labels of its components, but rather exists as a quantum superposition (this is completely analogous to how two fermions known to have spin 1/2 are together in quantum superposition of total spin 1 and 0). If the overall statistics of the fusion of all of several anyons is known, there is still ambiguity in the fusion of some subsets of those anyons, and each possibility is a unique quantum state. These multiple states provide a Hilbert space on which quantum computation can be done.\n\nTopological basis\n\nIn more than two dimensions, the spin\u2013statistics theorem states that any multiparticle state of indistinguishable particles has to obey either Bose\u2013Einstein or Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics. For any d\u00a0>\u00a02, the Lie groups SO(d,1) (which generalizes the Lorentz group) and Poincar\u00e9(d,1) have Z2 as their first homotopy group. Because the cyclic group Z2 is composed of two elements, only two possibilities remain. (The details are more involved than that, but this is the crucial point.)\n\nThe situation changes in two dimensions. Here the first homotopy group of SO(2,1), and also Poincar\u00e9(2,1), is Z''' (infinite cyclic). This means that Spin(2,1) is not the universal cover: it is not simply connected. In detail, there are projective representations of the special orthogonal group SO(2,1) which do not arise from linear representations of SO(2,1), or of its double cover, the spin group Spin(2,1). Anyons are evenly complementary representations of spin polarization by a charged particle.\n\nThis concept also applies to nonrelativistic systems. The relevant part here is that the spatial rotation group SO(2) has an infinite first homotopy group.\n\nThis fact is also related to the braid groups well known in knot theory. The relation can be understood when one considers the fact that in two dimensions the group of permutations of two particles is no longer the symmetric group S2 (with two elements) but rather the braid group B''2 (with an infinite number of elements). The essential point is that one braid can wind around the other one, an operation that can be performed infinitely often, and clockwise as well as counterclockwise.\n\nA very different approach to the stability-decoherence problem in quantum computing is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads and relying on braid theory to form stable logic gates.\n\nHigher dimensional generalization\n\nFractionalized excitations as point particles can be bosons, fermions or anyons in 2+1 spacetime dimensions.\nIt is known that point particles can be only either bosons or fermions in 3+1 and higher spacetime dimensions.\nHowever, the loop (or string) or membrane like excitations are extended objects can have fractionalized statistics. \nCurrent research works show that the loop and string like excitations exist for topological orders in the 3+1 dimensional spacetime, and their multi-loop/string-braiding statistics are the key signatures for identifying 3+1 dimensional topological orders.\nSource 6:\n# V. RECONSTRUCTING R AND F MATRICES WITH TWO d = 6 QUDITS\n\nOur findings have numerous potential applications. Firstly, the minimal resource requirement of our scheme provides a viable blueprint for explicitly demonstrating the non-Abelian statistics of anyons through experimental quantum simulation. We envision several platforms capable of manipulating the Hilbert space of a small number of higher-spin systems, such as Rydberg atoms, trapped atoms or ions, and multimode photonic systems, which can encode large Hilbert spaces. In these quantum simulations, it is not necessary to realise the Hamiltonian of the system to reveal the non-Abelian statistics of the anyons. Although engineering the Hamiltonians could offer some advantages, we believe that the aspect of quantum error correction remains the most promising application of non-Abelian anyons in quantum technologies. We foresee that our work can significantly contribute to the development and realisation of non-Abelian quantum error-correcting codes, which offer high error thresholds and minimal resource requirements, thereby advancing the field of fault-tolerant quantum computation.\n\n### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by EPSRC with Grant No. EP/R020612/1.

Here, we reveal the exotic Bloch oscillations (BOs) induced by non-Abelian fusion of Fibonacci anyons.

INTRODUCTION**\n\nQuantum computing has garnered significant attention in recent decades due to its potential for exponential acceleration over classical computers in solving specific problems. The principal challenges in the development of quantum computing lie in addressing noise and decoherence. Topological quantum computation presents a promising approach to solving these obstacles by utilizing non-Abelian anyons for encoding and manipulating quantum qubits in a nonlocal manner, where quantum gates are implemented by braiding of non-Abelian anyons and the measurement of quantum qubits is accomplished through fusion of anyons [1-5]. In contrast to fermions and bosons, the exchange of non-Abelian anyons is governed by unitary transformations. In addition, there are multiple possible outcomes upon fusion (merging) of two non-Abelian anyons, being different from other elementary particles that have only one fusion outcome. These two fundamental properties of non-Abelian anyons form the basis for topological quantum computation. Given their significant applications, extensive research has been conducted to identify physical systems capable of hosting non-Abelian anyons.\n\nTwo promising platforms for non-Abelian anyons are the Fibonacci and Ising anyon models, both exhibiting non-Abelian braiding statistics and fusion roles [1-25]. Specifically, Ising anyons have been predicted to exist as Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors [6-9], low-energy excitations of fractional quantum Hall states [12,13], Kitaev materials [14-16] and dense quark matter [17]. In addition, the vortex-bounded Dirac fermionic mode is also proposed to be among the Ising anyons [18-22]. However, Ising anyons alone are insufficient for universal quantum computations, therefore, incorporating non-topological processes becomes necessary [2]. In contrast, Fibonacci anyons offer a promising platform for universal topological quantum computation where all quantum gates are implemented through braiding manipulation in a topologically protected manner [23], and several candidates have been proposed to host Fibonacci anyons, including the fractional quantum Hall state with = 12\u22155 [24], interacting Majorana fermions [25], and so on [26-30]. In addition**,** some recent investigations have shown that anyonic statistics could trigger the appearance of many interesting effects [31-34]. In particular, it has been pointed out that quantum statistics could dramatically affect the Bloch oscillation (BO) of two Abelian anyons, where the oscillation frequency of two pseudofermions with a statistical angle of becomes half of that for two bosons [31, 32]. Motivated by the novel properties of anyonic BOs, it is intriguing to inquire whether non-Abelian statistics can give rise to more exotic BOs.\n\nIn this work, we firstly investigate the non-Abelian fusion BOs and Bloch-Zener oscillations (BZOs)\n\nof Fibonacci anyons in a one-dimensional lattice subject to external forces. It is shown that by adjusting the external forcing, it is possible to achieve either two or a single Wannier-Stack ladder of two Fibonacci anyons with a fusion-dependent internal energy level. When a single Wannier-Stack ladder accompanied with BOs emerges, the corresponding values of external force can determine the golden ratio for the fusion matrix of Fibonacci anyons. As for the case of three Fibonacci anyons, there are a pair of internal energy levels, making BZOs appear under a suitable value of external force. Furthermore, we design and fabricate RC circuits to experimentally simulate BOs and BZOs of Fibonacci anyons. Our work establishes a connection between BOs dynamics and non-Abelian fusion, suggesting a useful way to characterize non-Abelian fusion.\nSource 8:\n# **APPENDIX F: THE EIGENSPECTRA OF THREE FIBONACCI ANYONS AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE OVERALL OSCILLATION PERIOD WITH THREE INTERNAL**\n\nIn this section, we will show the simulation of voltage dynamics of the two Fibonacci anyon circuit simulator using LTSpice software. The size if designed circuits is set as L=7, which is equivalent to the dimensions used in Fig. 5(a) in the main text. Firstly, we simulate the voltage evolution in the designed circuit with *F*=1.5. The initial voltage is set as V3,5 5 (t = 0) = 1V. Fig. 17(a) shows the simulated voltage signal of 3,5 5 . It can be observed that the oscillation period of the voltage signal equals to 12.56ms. Then, we turn to the designed circuit with = 2, and the initial voltage is also given by 3,5 5 ( = 0) = 1V. Fig. 17(b) displays the simulated voltage signal of 3,5 5 (). Next, we calculate the time dynamics of the circuit with = 2, where the initial voltage distribution is given by V3,5 5 (t = 0) = 1V. The result shows the oscillation period of the voltage signal equals to 6.28ms.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_32_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\n</F>\n\n**FIG. 17.** The simulated voltage signals of 3,5 5 in the designed RC circuits (L=7) with F=1.5 for **(a)**, and F=2 for **(b)**. The simulated voltage signals of 6,13 5 in the designed RC circuits (L=20) with F=1.5 for **(c)**, and F=2 for **(d)**.\n\nTo evaluate the influence of the finite size effect, we simulate the voltage dynamics when the size of the circuit simulator is increased. Here, the size of the designed circuits is set as L=20. Firstly, we simulate the voltage evolution in the designed circuit with *F*=1.5. The initial voltage is set as 6,13 5 ( = 0) = 1V. Fig. 17(c) displays the measured voltage signal of 6,13 5 . We can find the oscillation period of the voltage signal equals to 12.56ms. Next, we turn to the designed circuit with = 2, and the initial voltage is also given by 6,13 5 ( = 0) = 1V. Fig. 17(d) shows the simulated voltage signal of 3,5 5 . It can be observed that the oscillation period of the voltage signal equals to 6.28ms. From about results, we can see that the oscillation periods are nearly unchanged with *L*=7 and 20.\n\n- [1] A.

This behavior is fundamentally distinct from fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons. Recently, quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a promising platform for creating topological Kitaev chains that can host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. In this work, we propose a minimal braiding setup in a linear array of quantum dots consisting of two minimal Kitaev chains coupled through an ancillary, normal quantum dot. We focus on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, such as interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single electron tunneling. We find that the errors caused by either of these effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot that mediates the exchange of the non-Abelian anyons. Moreover, we propose experimentally accessible methods to find this optimal operating regime and predict signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment.\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe exchange statistics of identical particles is a central concept in quantum mechanics. It allows for classifying elementary particles (e.g., electrons and photons) into fermions and bosons. In lower-dimensional spaces, there exist more exotic particles, e.g., non-Abelian anyons [1, 2]. By exchanging the positions of two such anyons, referred to as a braid operation, the many-body wavefunction transforms into a different one in the degenerate ground-state manifold. Thus, applying the same set of braid operations in a different order results in different unitary evolutions of the system. In addition, non-Abelian anyons are regarded as the building blocks of topological quantum computation, where qubit information is encoded in a pair of anyons, and quantum gates are implemented by anyonic braiding [2, 3]. Ideally, this protocol is intrinsically fault-tolerant, because both storage and processing of the quantum information are immune to local perturbations due to the topological protection. Therefore, demonstrating non-Abelian exchange statistics is of great importance to fundamental physics as well as to topological quantum computation.\n\nMajorana zero modes, which are Ising anyons, are the simplest example of non-Abelian anyons [3\u201314]. They can appear at the defects of a topological superconductor in the form of a mid-gap quasiparticle excitation [15\u2013 18]. In particular, it was proposed that topological Kitaev chains and Majorana zero modes can be engineered in a quantum-dot-superconductor array using a bottomup approach [19]. An advantage of this proposal is the intrinsic robustness against the effect of disorder that is ubiquitous in mesoscopic systems [20\u201322]. Moreover, by controlling the relative strengths of normal and superconducting couplings between neighboring quantum dots [23, 24], it is even possible to create Majoranas in the short-chain limit [25], albeit lacking true topological protection in this case. Based on these proposals, significant experimental progress has been achieved recently in realizing short Kitaev chains in two- [26\u201328] and threequantum-dot chains [29\u201331], supported by tunnel spectroscopy evidence of Majorana zero modes at finely tuned sweet spots. This opened up a new research field for Majorana physics and topological superconductivity [23, 32\u2013 55]. It also provides a new and promising platform to demonstrate the non-Abelian character of the exchange statistics [56\u201359], which has been elusive for decades.\n\nIn quasi-one-dimensional systems, braid operations can also be implemented by cyclic tuning of the pairwise Majorana couplings in a trijunction [60\u201363], or by a sequence of measurement on the fermion parity in Majorana pairs [64\u201366], both of which are mathematically equivalent to physically moving Majoranas in a Tjunction [67]. Furthermore, it was shown that the setup of trijunction braiding can be further simplified, where the role of a vertical topological superconductor branch can be replaced by a quantum dot [68\u201370]. However, it is a critical open question whether a braid protocol proposed for Majorana nanowires remains valid in the quantum dot setups with strong interactions. For example, it has been recently shown that strong interdot Coulomb interaction can prevent the extraction of Majorana quality measures [34], and that Coulomb interaction within a Kitaev chain can be detrimental to the protection of Majorana zero modes or qubits [25, 47, 50].\n\nIn the current work, we generalize the minimal braid protocol to engineered Kitaev chains, focusing on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, e.g., strong interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single-electron tunneling. Surprisingly, we find that the detrimental errors caused by both effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot. Moreover, we propose experimentally ac-\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> s.miles@tudelft.nl\n\n<sup>\u2020</sup> chunxiaoliu62@gmail.com"

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to design a provably optimal quantum circuit synthesis algorithm specifically for NISQ devices. Hmm, where do I even start? Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices are limited by their physical layout and environment, right? They don't have the full connectivity of universal quantum gates. So any algorithm must respect this constraint, which probably means it can only use certain types of operations or specific ways to connect qubits.\n\nNext, crosstalk errors. I think those are issues where signals from one qubit affect others nearby. This is a big problem because it makes the circuits more susceptible to noise, so we need robust methods to mitigate that. Maybe error correction codes like surface codes could be involved here, but how do they integrate with quantum circuit synthesis?\n\nThen there's amplitude damping. That's a type of decoherence channel where energy loss can cause qubits to decay from the excited state to the ground state. This introduces noise specifically at the higher energy levels, so our circuits must account for this when synthesizing operations.\n\nSo the main challenge is combining all these elements\u2014limited connectivity, crosstalk, amplitude damping\u2014into a synthesis algorithm that's both efficient and provably optimal. That means we need an algorithm with guaranteed performance bounds, ensuring it works well even as the number of qubits increases or other factors change.\n\nI recall something about using a graph-based approach for quantum circuit synthesis. Each qubit could be represented as a node in a graph, and operations between them as edges. But with limited connectivity, this graph might not have enough links to allow for universal operations. So perhaps we need to use some kind of decomposition strategy that works within the constraints.\n\nAnother thought is using linear algebra methods, where the problem can be formulated as finding a sequence of matrices (gates) whose product approximates the desired operator. This involves solving optimization problems, maybe using gradient descent or similar techniques, but I have to consider how crosstalk and amplitude damping affect these operations.\n\nI should also think about error correction. Maybe we need to encode our circuits into a larger system where errors can be corrected using the NISQ hardware's built-in error correction. This might involve adding extra qubits or gates that help compensate for the noise introduced by crosstalk and amplitude damping.\n\nBut wait, how do I ensure the algorithm is provably optimal? That\u2019s tricky because it requires mathematical proofs of convergence and performance guarantees. Perhaps we can use techniques like quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) or operator scaling to derive these bounds. These methods often involve analyzing the structure of the problem and proving that no better solution exists.\n\nI wonder if there are any existing algorithms for similar problems. Maybe in classical circuit synthesis, but for NISQ, it's more about respecting physical constraints while being optimal. So perhaps a hybrid approach combining quantum circuit design with error correction strategies would be needed.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the number of qubits and how they scale. As quantum computers get larger, the algorithms must remain efficient in terms of both gate count and computational overhead. This means looking for scalable methods that don't blow up in complexity as the problem size increases.\n\nAnother aspect is the physical layout. Since NISQ devices have a grid or certain connectivity patterns, the algorithm needs to exploit this to make operations more efficient without violating constraints. Maybe using some kind of graph structure where each node can only interact with its immediate neighbors or specific other nodes depending on the device's architecture.\n\nI'm also thinking about the importance of verifying the circuits after synthesis. This includes checking for errors during compilation, post-processing corrections, and ensuring that the final circuit is operationally equivalent despite the added noise from crosstalk and amplitude damping.\n\nMaybe I should outline a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Model the Problem**: Represent each qubit's state and the operations between them using linear algebra models.\n2. **Dealing with Decoherence**: Incorporate methods to account for amplitude damping, perhaps by including decoherence channels in the circuit design process.\n3. **Error Correction Integration**: Integrate error correction into the synthesis algorithm so that any added noise from crosstalk and amplitude damping is mitigated.\n4. **Connectivity Constraints Handling**: Ensure that the operations adhere to the physical connectivity of the NISQ device, using appropriate gate sequences or decompositions.\n5. **Optimization Techniques**: Use mathematical optimization methods, possibly including quantum singular value transforms or operator scaling, to find provably optimal circuits.\n6. **Verification and Post-Processing**: After compiling the circuit, verify it operationally and perform any necessary post-processing to account for additional noise sources.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about all these points. Maybe I should look into specific algorithms used in NISQ device synthesis, like those using graph-based representations or matrix scaling methods. Also, considering recent advancements in quantum error correction might provide inspiration on how to handle crosstalk and amplitude damping effectively.\n\nI also need to consider the practical implementation aspects. For instance, whether the algorithm can be implemented efficiently on current quantum hardware, which has specific gate depths and coherence times. Improving decomposition algorithms to reduce depth or increase parallelism could help, but it's a delicate balance between accuracy and performance.\n\nOverall, synthesizing an optimal circuit for NISQ devices is a complex problem that requires a blend of theoretical insights, practical implementation strategies, and careful consideration of physical constraints. I need to dive deeper into the mathematical models and optimization techniques that can handle the limited connectivity while accounting for the additional noise sources.\n</think>\n\nTo address the challenge of designing a provably optimal quantum circuit synthesis algorithm for NISQ devices, we can outline a structured approach that incorporates key considerations:\n\n### 1. **Modeling the Problem**\n   - Represent qubits as nodes in a graph and operations between them as edges.\n   - Use linear algebra models to describe state transformations.\n\n### 2. **Incorporating Decoherence Effects**\n   - Model amplitude damping using decoherence channels.\n   - Incorporate these effects during circuit design to account for energy loss.\n\n### 3. **Integrating Error Correction**\n   - Integrate error correction into the synthesis process to mitigate crosstalk and amplitude damping.\n   - Use NISQ hardware's built-in error correction mechanisms.\n\n### 4. **Handling Connectivity Constraints**\n   - Adhere to physical connectivity patterns of NISQ devices, using appropriate gate sequences or decompositions.\n   - Consider graph-based representations that respect limited connectivity.\n\n### 5. **Optimization Techniques**\n   - Utilize mathematical optimization methods, including quantum singular value transforms (QSVT) and operator scaling.\n   - Formulate the problem as an optimization task to find provably optimal circuits.\n\n### 6. **Verification and Post-Processing**\n   - Verify the synthesized circuit operationally.\n   - Perform post-processing to account for additional noise sources.\n\n### 7. **Implementation Considerations**\n   - Focus on algorithms that balance accuracy with practical constraints (e.g., gate depth, coherence times).\n   - Explore decomposition techniques that reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance.\n\nBy systematically addressing each component, we can develop a robust algorithm that meets the challenges posed by NISQ devices. This approach ensures both theoretical rigor and practical implementation feasibility."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this research paper on crosstalk error models for IBM's quantum devices. From what I gather, the authors are looking at how noise and errors propagate through their systems. They've set up experiments with two IBM quantum processors: IBM Lima and IBM Nairobi. \n\nIn Table 1, it looks like both devices have different characteristics\u2014like the number of qubits, quantum volume, processor type, crosstalk mode, and various error metrics. The Lima device has fewer qubits and a more severe crosstalk mode compared to the Nairobi version. That might be important for understanding how errors accumulate or affect performance.\n\nThe user mentioned that real systems are limited in data availability, so they're using a fake device as a substitute. They also note that crosstalk beyond NISQ systems is getting worse, which makes sense because as quantum hardware gets more fault-tolerant, the noise problem increases. The study uses RB and SRB protocols to analyze errors on these IBM devices.\n\nLooking at the EP table in Figure 6, it seems like different error scenarios were tested: only CNOT gates, simultaneous CNOTs, and with barriers. The results showed improvements when barriers were present, especially under severe crosstalk conditions. This is interesting because adding barriers might act as an additional mitigation step beyond standard protocols.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused about the limitations mentioned. It says that real systems are limited in data, which means their error models aren't perfect. They also highlight scalability issues with large number of qubits, making analysis difficult for the fake device. Maybe they're using tools like RB and SRB because they're designed to handle larger circuits better.\n\nI wonder how this study compares to previous ones on crosstalk metrics. It seems more comprehensive by incorporating barriers and real hardware data compared to some prior studies that might have been more theoretical or less detailed in their error models.\n\nOverall, the paper is trying to push the understanding of crosstalk beyond NISQ systems by using IBM's devices and a fake system for better insights. But I'm still not entirely clear on how exactly the barriers are being used as mitigation tools without traditional QIP methods. Also, the focus on topology might influence error propagation differently than expected.\n\nI should probably look into RB and SRB protocols more to grasp how barriers interact with these topologies and how that affects crosstalk errors. Maybe also check out other studies or papers that discuss quantum error correction techniques in detail.\n</think>\n\nThe study investigates crosstalk error models using IBM's quantum processors, IBM Lima and IBM Nairobi. Key findings:\n\n1. ** IBM Lima vs. IBM Nairobi**:\n   - Both devices have similar architectures but differ in qubit count (5 vs. 7) and crosstalk severity.\n   - Topology influences how errors propagate; the Lima device shows more reliance on the minor error protocol.\n\n2. **Fake Device Utilization**:\n   - A fake device is used for data analysis to approximate real systems, focusing on metrics like EP GRB1, GSRB, and topology.\n\n3. **Crosstalk Analysis**:\n   - The study explores various crosstalk modes (Minor, Medium, Severe) and error types (CNOT, Simultaneous CNOTs, Barriers).\n   - Barriers improve performance under severe crosstalk, suggesting they enhance mitigation.\n\n4. **RB and SRB Protocols**:\n   - These protocols are effective for larger circuits but challenge scalability due to complex noise profiles.\n   - The fake device's analysis provides insights into real hardware challenges.\n\n5. **Limitations and Considerations**:\n   - Real systems have limited data, necessitating the fake device approach.\n   - Scalability issues arise with large qubit counts, complicating error modeling.\n\n6. **Implications for Quantum Computing**:\n   - The study advances understanding of crosstalk by incorporating barriers beyond standard protocols.\n   - It highlights the need for robust error correction techniques in NISQ systems for practical implementation.\n\nIn conclusion, this research enhances crosstalk error modeling using IBM devices and a fake system, offering valuable insights while acknowledging challenges in scalability and real-world data limitations.",
      "context": "Source 1:\nGe Yan, Wenjie Wu, Yuheng Chen, et al\nQuantum computing is regarded as a promising paradigm that may overcome the current computational power bottlenecks in the post-Moore era. The increasing maturity of quantum processors, especially superconducting ones, provides more possibilities for the development and implementation of quantum algorithms. As the crucial stages for quantum algorithm implementation, the logic circuit design and quantum compiling have also received significant attention, which covers key technologies such as quantum logic circuit synthesis (also widely known as quantum architecture search) and optimization, as well as qubit mapping and routing. Recent studies suggest that the scale and precision of related algorithms are steadily increasing, especially with the integration of artificial intelligence methods. In this survey, we systematically review and summarize a vast body of literature, exploring the feasibility of an integrated design and optimization scheme that spans from the algorithmic level to quantum hardware, combining the steps of logic circuit design and compilation optimization. Leveraging the exceptional cognitive and learning capabilities of AI algorithms, one can reduce manual design costs, enhance the precision and efficiency of execution, and facilitate the implementation and validation of the superiority of quantum algorithms on hardware.\nIn recent years, quantum computing and quantum machine learning have garnered extensive attention. Due to their unique physical properties, quantum computing is considered the most promising new computing architecture to break through the existing computational power bottlenecks in the post-Moore era. Several notable quantum algorithms, such as Shor\u2019s algorithm for large integer factorization[170]and Grover\u2019s algorithm for unstructured search[64], have been theoretically proven to enjoy quantum superiority over classical algorithms. With the advent of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era in the past decade[80,157], quantum superiority has not only been demonstrated theoretically but also experimentally verified on quantum prototypes. For example, Google has demonstrated quantum superiority on a superconducting quantum111For conciseness and clarity, when referring to quantum hardware in this article, the default is the superconducting system, which is a mainstream quantum hardware technology.prototype through random circuit sampling tasks[12,197]. Similarly, the team with USTC has verified this through random boson sampling tasks on a photonic quantum prototype[211].\nCompared to random circuit sampling and random boson sampling, exploring the superiority of non-trivial and practically significant quantum algorithms presents a significant challenge, particularly given the constraints of existing quantum hardware, in terms of e.g., coherence time, noise, and physical topology. Many existing quantum algorithms utilize oracles[170,64,189], which are black-box unitary matrices where the corresponding unitary operation is known yet whose implementations are not explicitly defined. To best execute the algorithms, one needs to implement these unitary operators in the algorithms with minimal cost (such as circuit depth, gate count, etc.) and thus obtain the corresponding logic circuits of the algorithms. These logic circuits are further optimized with specific optimization goals. For instance, in the NISQ era, the focus is on optimizing two-qubit gates, while in the fault-tolerant quantum computing era, the emphasis shifts to optimizing T gates. Finally, the logic circuits must be compiled, requiring the optimal mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits and the addition of necessary SWAP gates to satisfy the circuit\u2019s connectivity requirements. For variational quantum algorithms, we can also design and optimize parameterized quantum circuits, breaking traditional design paradigms. By integrating hardware constraints, we seek a balance between theoretical precision and noise (where reducing circuit depth decreases theoretical precision, but reducing noise can decrease execution errors) to achieve optimal results.\nFigure1shows the entire process from quantum algorithm design to execution. This process includes transforming a quantum algorithm into unitary transformations, generating logic circuits through synthesis and optimization methods, and then compiling these circuits, considering the physical qubit topology and other quantum hardware constraints, into executable quantum programs on target quantum processors. In other words, the transformation from a quantum algorithm to an executable quantum program can be divided into three steps: quantum algorithm design, quantum logic circuit design, and quantum compiling. In reviews of modern quantum computing technology[81], these steps are often collectively referred to as quantum circuit compilation, with relevant research briefly summarized. Early work also roughly summarized quantum circuit compilation in the NISQ era with heuristic methods[102], including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization, and planning algorithms. In this paper, we focus on efficiently transforming quantum algorithms into executable quantum programs by comprehensively summarizing research on logic circuit synthesis and optimization, as well as qubit mapping and routing. Additionally, we provide prospects and insights into automatic quantum logic circuit design and compilation optimization, which enables researchers to focus more on algorithm design, fully leveraging the potential of NISQ-era quantum hardware and promoting the practical application and superiority verification of quantum algorithms.\nBesides the Clifford+T set, there are other general quantum gate sets, such as the parameterized rotation gates Rx(\u03b8)\ud835\udf03(\\theta)( italic_\u03b8 ), Ry(\u03b8)\ud835\udf03(\\theta)( italic_\u03b8 ), and Rz(\u03b8)\ud835\udf03(\\theta)( italic_\u03b8 ), along with the CNOT gate, which is commonly used in quantum machine learning. The unitary matrices for the three parameterized rotation gates are as follows:\nCompared to the Clifford+T set, the main advantage of this universal gate set is that all single-qubit gates are parameterized, allowing for continuous transformations. As a result, the number of gates required to approximate arbitrary single-qubit gates is significantly reduced compared to using Clifford+T gates with discrete angles. However, the arbitrary angles of parameterized gates can affect accuracy when implemented on NISQ-era quantum computers. In the future fault-tolerant quantum computing era, it is also challenging to implement these gates at arbitrary angles through encoding.\nAdditionally, some universal quantum gate sets are designed for specific problems. For instance, the NCV quantum gate set is used to optimize circuits[129,122,124,123], particularly multi-controlled-NOT gates. This set includes NOT gates, CNOT gates, and Controlled-V/V\u2020gates, where the unitary matrix for the V gate is\nSome studies also use built-in gates on superconducting quantum computers directly, like the iSWAP=ei\u2062\u03c04\u2062(X\u2062X+Y\u2062Y)absentsuperscript\ud835\udc52i\ud835\udf0b4\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4c=e^{\\text{i}\\frac{\\pi}{4}(XX+YY)}= italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT i divide start_ARG italic_\u03c0 end_ARG start_ARG 4 end_ARG ( italic_X italic_X + italic_Y italic_Y ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPTgate in[174].

By adding a source node and a sink node at the beginning and end of the quantum circuit, respectively, and treating each quantum gate as a node, we create a directed graph. Adjacent gates on the same qubit are connected by directed edges, and multi-qubit gates introduce additional edges. These directed edges represent the sequence in which the gates are applied. The advantages of using DAGs to represent quantum circuits are: (1) the structure of quantum circuits naturally transforms into DAGs; (2) DAGs can represent the application order of quantum gates and the control qubits of multi-qubit gates, maximizing the advantages of DAGs ; and (3) graph neural networks can effectively extract and compute features of nodes and edges, handling large-scale quantum circuits.\nAdditionally, there is a special circuit representation in the form of directed acyclic graphs called Quantum Multiple-Valued Decision Diagram (QMDD)[143]. As illustrated in Figure2, starting from theq2subscript\ud835\udc5e2q_{2}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPTlevel, which is a2\u00d72222\\times 22 \u00d7 2matrix, we build the diagram layer by layer according to the transformation matrix.

There are four types ofq2subscript\ud835\udc5e2q_{2}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPTlevel matrices in the circuit, so this level has four nodes.

The completed QMDD diagram is shown at the bottom of the QMDD module in Figure2.\nBased on the representation of the quantum gate model, we can further characterize quantum circuits using algebraic methods, such as linear Boolean functions or phase polynomials[8,136,128,6,183]. These polynomial representation algorithms focus more on the quantum state rather than the specific quantum gates acting on the state. An arbitrary single-qubit quantum gate can be seen as inducing the following transformations on the quantum state:\nwhere|x\u27e9\u2192|g\u2062(x)\u27e9\u2192ket\ud835\udc65ket\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc65\\ket{x}\\rightarrow\\ket{g(x)}| start_ARG italic_x end_ARG \u27e9 \u2192 | start_ARG italic_g ( italic_x ) end_ARG \u27e9is a reversible transformation, andei\u2062p\u2062(x)superscript\ud835\udc52i\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc65e^{\\text{i}p(x)}italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT i italic_p ( italic_x ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPTrepresents the phase information imparted by the quantum gate to the current quantum state|x\u27e9ket\ud835\udc65\\ket{x}| start_ARG italic_x end_ARG \u27e9. Since reversible transformations in quantum circuits are relatively straightforward to analyze, phase polynomial expressions focus more on the phase information contributed by quantum gates, particularly gates like Z, S, T, Rz(\u03b8)\ud835\udf03(\\theta)( italic_\u03b8 )and CZ. Given that the T gate is a crucial target in quantum circuit optimization, phase polynomial expressions play a significant role in optimizing circuits. Below, we present a specific example of a phase polynomial. For ann\ud835\udc5bnitalic_n-qubit circuit, assuming that there are only two types of gates, CNOT and Rz(\u03b8)\ud835\udf03(\\theta)( italic_\u03b8 ), the phase functionp\u2062(x)\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc65p(x)italic_p ( italic_x )for the sample quantum circuit in Figure2can be expressed as:\nSource 2:\n## 1.3 Open Problems and Discussions\n\nWhile noise-aware CNOT circuit routing is not immediately applicable to NISQ devices, our results pave the way to a fully noise-aware routing strategy. Here, we outline how NAPermRowCol could be extended to route a noisy quantum circuit over a universal gate set.\n\nOn one hand, we need an efficient cost function to quantify a noisy circuit's reliability. For noisy CNOT circuits, we use a generalized Pauli channel to model noise, assuming CNOT gates are not parallelized and idle qubits are noiseless. Although our empirical study shows that Cost approximates Prob closely, these simplifications make our cost function less general. A major room for improvement is to drop these assumptions.\n\nFor example, the generalized Pauli channels are a widely applicable model in quantum information, but they do not encompass all possible completely positive maps (e.g., complex multi-qubit interactions, non-Pauli types of noise and decoherence). Modelling a noisy quantum circuit with a more general channel representation is an important avenue for future work. Additionally, we should allow gate parallelization and account for errors resulting from the T1/T2 time. Moreover, we should consider single-qubit gate errors and readout errors arising from qubit state measurement. Depending on the quantum computing platform, we should also factor in error sources such as thermal relaxation and crosstalk.\n\nIn summary, the new cost function should accurately and efficiently quantify the dynamic error characteristics of a NISQ-executable circuit. Next, we can combine it with various circuit synthesis frameworks [25, 44, 47] to generalize NAPermRowCol and route an arbitrary quantum program on NISQ hardware. This includes designing noise-aware heuristics on a vertex-and-edge-weighted Steiner tree. We will then enhance the routed circuit's reliability by reducing the cost evaluation.\n\nOn the other hand, a routing algorithm's performance may decrease as the system scales with the qubit count and circuit complexity. For example, NAPermRowCol shows modest improvements when synthesizing a CNOT circuit over more than 16 qubits. This means we may need to refine the noise-aware heuristics to improve a routing algorithm's scalability.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [25] Vlad Gheorghiu, Jiaxin Huang, Sarah Meng Li, Michele Mosca & Priyanka Mukhopadhyay (2022): *Reducing the CNOT count for Clifford+T circuits on NISQ architectures*.

Our model accounts for the propagation of arbitrary single qubit errors through the circuit. We find that even with a small noise rate, the quality of the obtained optima implies that a single-qubit error rate of1/n\u200bD1\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc371/nD(wheren\ud835\udc5bnis the number of qubits andD\ud835\udc37Dis the circuit depth) is needed for the possibility of a quantum advantage. We estimate that this translates to an error rate lower than10\u22126superscript10610^{-6}using QAOA for classical optimization problems with 2D circuits.\nSignificant advances in the capabilities of quantum information processing hardware have been made recently, with the achievement of an important milestone of having reached quantum advantage[1,2,3]. In addition to developing technologies towards the final goal of a fault tolerant quantum computer, there is widespread interest in exploring the capabilities of the currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices[4]. This has inspired a number of heuristic quantum algorithms for NISQ devices[5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,16,19,20,21], but it remains unclear if they can provide a quantum advantage for practically interesting problems.\nOne of the proposed applications for NISQ devices is to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Since this class of problems contains NP-hard instances, it is considered hard to solve on classical computers[22]. Quantum circuits can explore larger state spaces (e.g. entangled states) compared to their classical counterparts and hence there is a possibility of quantum speedup in some instances of these problems. Several heuristic variational quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving optimization problems[9,10,11,12,13,8,14,15], most notably the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)[23]. While variational algorithms in general lack provable guarantees for quantum speedups, there is a growing body of literature that suggests its use for practically interesting problems that remain hard to solve on classical computers[24,25,26], as well as provides evidence for its experimental feasibility[27,28]. However, a number of algorithmic challenges to these heuristics which stem from the limitations on the accessible circuit architectures, such as barren plateaus[29], expressibility of the ansatz[30,31], or reachability deficits[32], have been identified.\nThe influence of noise in the quantum devices on variational algorithms is an important consideration for assessing their utility in the near term. Noise-induced barren plateaus in the optimization landscape of the variational ansatz have been identified[33]. Numerical modelling of the impact of noise has also been attempted[34,35], but this analysis is limited to very small circuit sizes. A set of rigorous results on the impact of noise in the quality of the optima obtained have been recently provided using entropic arguments[36,37,38]. By simply tracking the von Neumann entropy of the quantum state, in Refs.[37,38]it was argued that beyond circuit depths of\u0398\u200b(log\u200b(n))\u0398log\ud835\udc5b\\Theta(\\text{log}(n))with depolarizing noise, the output state is very close to the maximally mixed state. Ref.[36]improved on this result and showed that even beyond circuit depths of\u0398\u200b(1)\u03981\\Theta(1), the quality of solution of a large class of classical optimization algorithm obtained from this circuit can be achieved with a classical algorithm.\nHowever, while these analyses already provide provable limits on the quality of variational quantum algorithms that can inform current experiments, they likely underestimate the impact of noise in variational circuits used in practice. This underestimation arises from the fact that these bounds are applicable toanyquantum circuit, and consequently they also bound performance of circuits which do not create significant entanglement in the quantum state. Therefore, these bounds do not capture propagation of errors through the quantum circuit. Furthermore, these bounds are also loose for noise models, such as amplitude damping noise, which can possiblydecreasethe entropy in the quantum circuit \u2014 however, for a typical quantum circuit, it is expected that the presence of such noise would still degrade its performance.\nIn this paper, we propose a random circuit model that attempts to analyze the impact of noise in NISQ devices used to variationally solve classical optimization problems. Unlike previously proposed random circuit models, our model captures the fact that these circuits map product states for product states i.e. ideally, a typical member of this circuit family starts with a product state, builds entanglement in between the qubits and then disentangles it to another (product) state which is the bit-string that solves the classical optimization problem. Our study here is thus different from recent works that have studied the impact of noise in Haar-random quantum circuits[39,40,41,42]with geometric constraints, where a typical member of these circuit families has an anti-concentrated output state, which is in stark contrast to what is expected for variational quantum circuits that ideally output a state close to the ground state.\nWe perform an average case analysis on this distribution of circuits, and find that noise propagates very rapidly through the circuit, severely limiting the performance of the circuits. We provide both numerical results and analytical scalings for three different architectures: 1D, 2D, and nonlocal. Our results indicate that to obtain a solution to a classical optimization problem within a fixed multiplicative error of its true solution with a constant rate of noisep\ud835\udc5dp, the circuit depth of a typical member of this distribution has to be smaller thanmax\u2061(O\u200b(p\u22121/2),O\u200b(1/(p\u200bn)))\ud835\udc42superscript\ud835\udc5d12\ud835\udc421\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5b\\max\\left(O(p^{-1/2}),O(1/(pn))\\right)in 1D andmax\u2061(O\u200b(p\u22121/3),O\u200b(1/(p\u200bn)))\ud835\udc42superscript\ud835\udc5d13\ud835\udc421\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5b\\max\\left(O(p^{-1/3}),O(1/(pn))\\right)in 2D. Furthermore, it follows from our analysis that the impact of error is qualitatively similar for different noise models in contrast to Ref.[36], which relies on the noise-channel being primitive and unital. Moreover, our analysis technique can easily be extended to understanding impact of noise on variational quantum algorithms for solving quantum optimization problem (i.e. finding the ground state of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian).\nIn addition to this average case analysis, we provide a concentration result for low depth local circuits which shows that this average is representative of a typical circuit. However, we note that this does leave open the question of whether a clever method of choosing the parameters of a variational quantum circuit could be devised (for e.g. with a closed loop optimization of the noisy quantum circuit), such that the resulting circuit avoids the predicted proliferation of noise.\nAn important fact that we will use to calculate\u03a6avg\ud835\udc9csuperscriptsubscript\u03a6avg\ud835\udc9c\\Phi_{\\text{avg}}^{\\mathcal{A}}is that the twirl of a 2-qubit quantum channel\u2133\u2133\\mathcal{M}over the Haar measure is a 2-qubit depolarizing channel (Fig.2a)[43]i.e.,\nwhere, ifAksubscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc58A_{k}represents thek\ud835\udc58k-th Kraus operator of the channel\u2133\u2133\\mathcal{M}, then\nSince this expression applies to arbitrary noise channels, it follows that the specific choice of noise does not greatly impact the qualitative behaviour of our model, with only the noise strength\u03bb\ud835\udf06\\lambdadepending on the specific channel.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we will consider that the noise is a depolarizing channel of strengthp\ud835\udc5dp,\ni.e. an error, interpreted at tracing out the qubit and replacing it withI/2\ud835\udc3c2I/2, occurring with probabilityp\ud835\udc5dp. When this noise channel acts on two qubits, there are three distinct possibilities \u2014 no errors occurred (i.e.\u03c1\u2192\u03c1\u2192\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0c\\rho\\to\\rho), both the qubits experienced errors (\u03c1\u2192I\u22972/4\u2192\ud835\udf0csuperscript\ud835\udc3ctensor-productabsent24\\rho\\to I^{\\otimes 2}/4) or only one qubit experienced error (i.e.\u03c1\u2192I/2\u2297tr1\u200b(\u03c1)\u2192\ud835\udf0ctensor-product\ud835\udc3c2subscripttr1\ud835\udf0c\\rho\\to I/2\\otimes\\text{tr}_{1}(\\rho)ortr2\u200b(\u03c1)\u2297I/2tensor-productsubscripttr2\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc3c2\\text{tr}_{2}(\\rho)\\otimes I/2).

Implementation\n\nWe remark that the number D of Trotter layers, required to achieve a desired Trotter decomposition error \u03b5Trot in Eq. (6), depends on the structure of the Hamiltonian of a target open quantum system, the simulation time t, and the order k of the Trotter-Suzuki product formula considered in simulations. As an example, we may consider the first order product formula (k = 1), and a linear chain (or square grid) structure of qubits with a uniform nearest-neighbor coupling strength J and on-site energy E (see Eq. (2)). In this case, the number D of Trotter layers can be expressed as\n\n$$D=O\\left(\\frac{n^{d}J(J+E)t^{2}}{\\varepsilon_{\\rm{Trot}}}\\right),\\tag{22}$$\n\nwhere d = 1 (or 2) for the linear chain (or twodimensional square grid) structure (for other classes of\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_10_Figure_8.jpeg</img>\nFIG. 8.

AMPLITUDE DAMPING\n\nSo far we have demonstrated that the stochastic Pauli noise models in Eq. (14) can be implemented by using our partial noise mitigation scheme. Here we show how the Lindblad models beyond the stochastic Pauli noise can be implemented on quantum devices with controlled decoherence rates, such as amplitude damping that has been widely considered in classical simulations of opensystem dynamics [3]. We demonstrate that local noise models can be efficiently implemented by using reset operations without introducing costly ancilla qubits.\n\n# A. Amplitude damping noise with ancilla qubits\n\nThe local amplitude damping of qubit m is described by the Kraus operator in the form\n\n$${\\cal E}^{(\\rm ad)}_{m}(\\hat{\\rho})=w_{m}\\hat{\\sigma}^{(-)}_{m}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{\\sigma}^{(+)}_{m}+\\hat{\\sigma}^{(0)}_{m}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{\\sigma}^{(0)}_{m},\\tag{24}$$\n\nwith \u02c6\u03c3 (\u2212) m = |0\u27e9 \u27e81|m = 1 2 (X\u02c6m + iY\u02c6m), \u02c6\u03c3 (+) m = |1\u27e9 \u27e80|m = 1 2 (X\u02c6m \u2212 iY\u02c6m) and \u02c6\u03c3 (m) 0 = 1 2 (1 + \u221a 1 \u2212 wm) \u02c6Im + 1 2 (1 \u2212 \u221a 1 \u2212 wm)Z\u02c6m, where wm represents an incoherent transition probability from |1\u27e9 to |0\u27e9 of qubit m. The amplitude damping noise model in Eq. (24) cannot be described by the stochastic Pauli noise channels [59] in Eq. (10), thus requiring an approach different from Sec. III. To that end, one could introduce an ancilla qubit coupled to the qubit m where the interaction between them is described by a circuit shown in Fig. 8(a), consisting of three CNOT gates and single-qubit rotations R\u02c6 Y (\u00b1\u03b8/2) = e \u2213i\u03b8Y\u02c6a/4 with a Pauli operator Y\u02c6 a acting on the ancilla qubit [60].\n\nIn this approach, the initial state of the ancilla qubit is reset to |0\u27e9 in each Trotter layer, as schematically shown in Fig. 8(b), and the amplitude damping probability wm = sin2 (\u03b8/2) can be controlled by the singlequbit rotations R\u02c6 Y (\u00b1\u03b8/2). The Lindblad dissipator corresponding to the repeated application of this quantum channel to each Trotter layer is described by\n\n$${\\cal D}_{\\rm ad}[\\hat{\\rho}]=\\sum_{m=1}^{n}\\Gamma_{m}\\left(\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(-)}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(+)}-\\frac{1}{2}\\{\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(+)}\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(-)},\\hat{\\rho}\\}\\right),\\tag{25}$$\n\n$$\\Gamma_{m}=\\ w_{m}/\\Delta t,\\tag{26}$$\n\nwhere {A, \u02c6 B\u02c6} denotes the anticommutator of two operators A\u02c6 and B\u02c6.\n\nHowever, this approach has several drawbacks. The ancilla qubits are not desirable on current quantum hardware due to the limited number of qubits (up to 433 qubits on the most recent IBMQ device), and the restricted qubit connectivity, e.g. superconducting devices have at most nearest-neighbour qubit connectivity distributed on a square 2D grid such as current Google quantum devices. Furthermore, additional twoqubit gates are needed to couple system qubits to ancilla qubits, as shown in Fig. 8, increasing the mitigation cost of our scheme. The use of mid-circuit measurement operations may also introduce non-negligible errors, both because of cross-talk and because the execution time of a measurement operation can be an order of magnitude longer than that of a two-qubit gate as in current IBMQ and Google superconducting quantum devices. During the long execution time of the measurement operation, unknown errors may occur, resulting in increased stochastic Pauli noise probabilities when Randomized Compiling is employed. Therefore, the measurement-based implementation of the amplitude damping may increase the total mitigation cost. To test this prediction, we performed simulations using the emulated quantum device ibmq oslo and found that for an open system encoded in two qubits (n = 2) the amplitude damping and stochastic Pauli noise channels can be implemented at the same time, but the total error probability P k>0 \u03f5k of the stochastic Pauli noise channels is substantially increased. This implies that the amplitude damping noise cannot be efficiently implemented by using the scheme in Fig. 8, based on ancilla qubits and measurement operations. In section V we comment on other recently proposed schemes to simulate amplitude\n\ndamping which require ancilla qubits and face the same issues as the method previously discussed.\n\n### B. Amplitude damping noise without ancilla qubits\n\nHere we propose a different approach where the amplitude damping is implemented solely by reset operations, which does not require ancilla qubits and mid-circuit measurement operations.\n\nWe consider the stochastic application of the following reset channel to each Trotter layer\n\n$${\\cal E}_{m}^{(\\rm reset)}(\\hat{\\rho})=(1-w_{m})\\hat{I}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{I}+w_{m}{\\cal R}_{m}(\\hat{\\rho}),\\tag{27}$$\n\n$${\\cal R}_{m}(\\hat{\\rho})=\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle0\\right|_{m}\\hat{\\rho}\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle0\\right|_{m}+\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(-)}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(+)},\\tag{28}$$\n\nwhere Rm(\u02c6\u03c1) is a reset operation applied to qubit m with probability wm. Recently, fast high-fidelity reset operations (with reset failure probability \u223c 10\u22123 and time durations comparable to two-qubit gates with very low crosstalk error [61]) have been demonstrated for both superconducting [36] and ion-trap quantum devices [62]. The stochastic application of the reset channel enables one to implement a Lindblad dissipator in the form\n\n$${\\cal D}_{r}[\\hat{\\rho}]=\\sum_{m=1}^{n}\\Gamma_{m}\\left(\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(-)}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(+)}-\\frac{1}{2}\\{\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(+)}\\hat{\\sigma}_{m}^{(-)},\\hat{\\rho}\\}\\right)\\tag{29}$$\n\n$$+\\sum_{m=1}^{n}\\frac{\\Gamma_{m}}{4}(\\hat{Z}_{m}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{Z}_{m}-\\hat{\\rho}),$$\n\n$$\\Gamma_{m}=w_{m}/\\Delta t,\\tag{30}$$\n\nwhich is a sum of the amplitude damping noise with rates \u0393m and single-qubit dephasing with rates \u0393m/4. We note that the single-qubit dephasing rates can be controlled by our partial noise mitigation scheme in Sec. III B. Therefore one can selectively implement the amplitude damping only, in principle, by using the reset operation.\nSource 5:\n# Optimized Noise Suppression for Quantum Circuits\n\nWe build on the routing algorithm TAP+TS proposed in Ref. [61]. Here, TAP+TS refers to token allocation problem and token swapping problem, two NP-hard optimization problems whose solutions are the central building blocks of the algorithm. TAP+TS is itself based on the exact binary linear programming approach of Ref. [77]. Typically, such methods need a considerably smaller number of swap gates than state-of-the art heuristics at the expense of an increased running time. However, TAP+TS is still faster by a factor of 100 on average than exact methods, which are intractable even for moderate input sizes with less than ten qubits [77, 78]. Furthermore, in contrast to other heuristics, it returns provable bounds on the quality of the obtained solution. We now summarize the three phases of the TAP+TS algorithm.\n\n- 1. All two-qubit gates are grouped into layers. A layer is a set of gates on disjoint qubits that can be executed in parallel.\n- 2. After grouping, the token allocation problem (TAP) is solved via binary linear programming. This is the computationally most expensive step in the algorithm. The solution of the TAP is a mapping (allocation) from circuit qubits to hardware qubits for each layer. Here, the objective function to minimize is a lower bound on the total number of swaps required.\n- 3. Finally, after allocating qubits in each layer, swaps between consecutive layers are inserted to transform between consecutive qubit allocations. For each pair of consecutive allocations, this task forms an instance of the token swapping problem, which is also NP-hard in itself. The token swapping problems are solved by an efficient approximation algorithm, an improved version of the algorithm originally proposed in Ref. [79].\n\nHere, we enhance this routing algorithm in two ways. First, we improve the TAP binary linear model compared to Ref. [61] by giving a complete description of the convex hull of specific constrained binary quadric polytopes. On the theoretical side, this result generalizes beyond our application. Computationally, for our instances it improves the running time when solving the model with a branch-and-cut algorithm by about a factor of two on average. Second, we incorporate noise data in the cost function of the model. Besides single-qubit, two-qubit and readout error rates, we also incorporate crosstalk.\n\nTo ensure our work is self-contained, we summarize the TAP binary linear programming model from Ref. [61]. Afterwards, we strengthen the model and extend the objective function to incorporate noise data via additional quadratic terms. We consider a quantum circuit on a set *Q* of qubits, called circuit qubits, and a sequence of *N >* 0 layers *L* 1 *, . . . , LN* . Each layer *L t* \u2282 *Q* \u00d7 *Q* consists of disjoint pairs of circuit qubits representing the two-qubit gates in the circuit. Moreover, we consider a directed graph *H* = (*V, A*) with vertices *V* , |*V* | \u2265 |*Q*|, and arc set *A* representing the hardware qubits and hardware-native CX gates, respectively. Here, *A* is assumed to be symmetric, that is if (*i, j*) \u2208 *A*, then also (*j, i*) \u2208 *A*. For *i, j* \u2208 *V* , let *dH*(*i, j*) denote the length of a shortest path connecting *i* and *j* in *H*. We introduce binary variables with the following interpretations. Variable *x t q,i,j* \u2208 { 0*,* 1 } takes value 1 if qubit *q* \u2208 *Q* changes its assignment from node *i* \u2208 *V* to node *j* \u2208 *V* between layer *t* and *t* + 1 from { 1*, . . . , N* }, and 0 otherwise. The auxiliary variable *w t q,i* \u2208 { 0*,* 1 } takes value 1 when qubit *q* \u2208 *Q* is located at node *i* \u2208 *V* in layer *t* \u2208 { 1*, . . . , N* }, and 0 otherwise. Further, the auxiliary variable *z t* (*p,q*)*,*(*i,j*) \u2208 { 0*,* 1 } takes value 1 when gate (*p, q*) \u2208 *L t* is performed along edge (*i, j*) and 0 otherwise. With these notions, the TAP is modeled by the following quadratic binary program, see Ref. [61]:\n\nX\n\n$$\\min_{x}\\quad\\sum_{t=1}^{L-1}\\sum_{q\\in Q}\\sum_{i,j\\in V\\times V}d_{H}(i,j)x_{q,i,j}^{t}\\tag{1a}$$\n\ns.t.  \n\n$$w^{t}_{q,i}=\\sum_{j\\in V}x^{t}_{q,i,j}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\forall1\\leq t\\leq N-1,\\forall i\\in V,\\forall q\\in Q\\tag{1b}$$\n\n$$t=\\sum_{j\\in V}t^{-1}_{q,i,j}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\forall i\\in V,\\forall i\\in V,\\forall q\\in Q\\tag{1c}$$\nSource 6:\n# arXiv:2501.02222v1 [quant-ph] 4 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n# A Toffoli Gate Decomposition via Echoed Cross-Resonance Gates\n\nMuhammad AbuGhanem1,2\n\n1 Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, 11566, Egypt and\n\n2 Zewail City of Science, Technology and Innovation, Giza, 12678, Egypt\u2217\n\n(Dated: January 7, 2025)\n\nQuantum computing has garnered significant interest for its potential to solve certain computational problems much faster than the best-known classical algorithms. A fully functional and scalable quantum computer could transform various fields such as scientific research, material science, chemistry, and drug discovery. However, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum hardware faces challenges including decoherence, gate infidelity, and restricted qubit connectivity. Efficient implementation of multi-qubit gates is critical to advancing quantum computing, especially given the constraints of near-term quantum hardware, such as the absence of all-to-all qubit connectivity. Among these gates, the Toffoli gate (or CCNOT gate) plays a pivotal role in a wide range of quantum algorithms and error correction schemes. While various decomposition strategies have been proposed, they often assume idealized all-to-all connectivity, which is not available on most NISQ hardware. This paper introduces a novel decomposition of the Toffoli gate using Echoed Cross-Resonance (ECR) gates, a native operation for many superconducting qubit architectures, including IBM Quantum's hardware. By leveraging the inherent compatibility of ECR gates with superconducting qubit technology, this approach is intended to facilitate the implementation of the Toffoli gate, potentially reducing circuit depth and enhancing the efficiency of quantum circuits implementations on near-term quantum hardware.\n\nKeywords: Toffoli gate, Echoed Cross-Resonance gate, ECR gate, hardware-specific optimizations, all-to-all connectivity, near-neighbour connectivity, limited qubit connectivity, IBM Quantum hardware, superconducting NISQ devices.\n\n### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nQuantum computing represents a transformative leap in solving complex problems that are infeasible for classical computers [1, 2]. With potential applications spanning artificial intelligence, cryptography, materials science, drug discovery, and communications, quantum technologies are poised to reshape numerous industries [3].\n\nDespite rapid advancements in quantum technologies, many of these hardware limitations persist, making the optimization of quantum circuits critical for maximizing the performance of existing devices [4]. As quantum computing progresses towards practical applications [2], overcoming the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices becomes crucial [4]. These devices face challenges such as limited qubit connectivity, gate infidelity, and noise, which complicate the implementation of efficient quantum algorithms and restrict scalability [5].\n\nThe primary challenge in constructing a quantum computer lies in the fragility of quantum information, which is highly susceptible to various noise sources [6]. This vulnerability arises because isolating quantum systems from external disturbances conflicts with the ability to control them effectively for computations, making noise an unavoidable issue [7]. Noise sources include qubit imperfections, control systems, deficiencies in materials, errors in state preparation and measurement, and external factors like stray electromagnetic fields or cosmic rays [8]. While some noise can be mitigated through improved controls [9], better materials [10], and advanced shielding techniques [11\u201313], other sources are inherently difficult or even impossible to eliminate [14\u201316].\n\nEfficient implementation of multi-qubit gates, form the backbone of quantum algorithms and error correction protocols, enabling their practical execution on quantum hardware [3, 17]. Among these, the Toffoli gate\u2014also known as the CCNOT or CCX gate\u2014 is of particular significance [18]. The gate's functionality makes it indispensable for applications such as quantum arithmetic, reversible logic synthesis, Grover's search algorithm, and quantum error correction schemes (see Section V A). However, its multi-qubit nature poses challenges for nearterm quantum devices due to limited qubit connectivity, intrinsic noise, and hardware-specific constraints [4].\n\nWhile various decomposition strategies have been proposed, they often assume idealized all-to-all connectivity, which is not available on most (near-tearm) quantum hardware. This gap highlights the need for hardware-specific optimizations that address practical constraints [4]. This work proposes a novel decomposition of the Toffoli gate using Echoed Cross-Resonance (ECR) gates, a native operation in many superconducting qubit systems, including IBM Quantum's quantum hardware [3]. Unlike traditional approaches, the ECRbased decomposition leverages hardware-native operations to minimize circuit depth and mitigate noise.\n\nThe ECR gate [19\u201322] is a 2-qubit entangling gate native to superconducting qubit architectures, particularly in IBM Quantum's quantum hardware. It operates by\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> gaa1nem@gmail.com\n\ndriving one qubit (control) at the resonance frequency of another qubit (target), inducing an effective ZX-type interaction. The \"echoed\" design involves sandwiching the cross-resonance pulse between two \u03c0-pulses, effectively canceling out unwanted 1-qubit Z errors and enhancing gate fidelity. This operation, when combined with local 1-qubit rotations, can implement universal 2-qubit gates, such as CNOT. Unlike the standard CNOT gate, the ECR gate's implementation on superconducting qubits aligns better with hardware constraints like limited connectivity and reduces the overhead of additional calibration steps.\n\nBy leveraging the ECR gate's properties, our approach aims to achieve improved compatibility with superconducting qubit platforms, minimizing circuit depth and addressing connectivity limitations inherent in NISQ devices, paving the way for practical implementation and optimizing performance of Toffoli gates and similar multiqubit operations on near-term quantum devices.\nSource 7:\n# ABSTRACT\n\n2.2.2 Compilation Objectives. QAOA circuits are characterized by their use of parameterized unitary gates, which are optimized through classical feedback loops. The compilation process must address the following parts:\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_25.jpeg</img>\nFigure 1: A five-qubit QAOA-Maxcut circuit example: (a) the input problem graph. (b) and (c) are two valid circuits.\n</F>\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_2_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFigure 2: (a) Hardware coupling map; (b) One possible compiled version of the circuit corresponding to the input problem graph, (c) Another possible compiled version of the same circuit. Due to the qubit mapping process, the number of gates and the depth of the circuit in (c) are reduced compared to (b), illustrating a more efficient compilation.\n</F>\n\nqubit connectivity and the potential for gate errors, logical qubits often need to be connected using SWAP gates. This mapping must also account for hardware limitations such as gate fidelities and qubit coherence times to ensure accurate computation.\n\n- Gates Optimization: Optimizing the order of unitary gates in QAOA circuits is crucial for minimizing circuit depth and error rates. The commutativity of two-qubit gates in QAOA provides flexibility in gate sequencing, which can be leveraged to enhance performance.\nBy addressing these aspects\u2014problem-graph structure, qubit mapping, and gate optimization\u2014the compilation of QAOA circuits aims to enhance performance and adapt to the constraints of quantum hardware effectively. Fig. 2 illustrates how different optimization strategies can affect circuit depth and gate count, highlighting the impact of gate ordering and SWAP insertion on overall circuit efficiency.\n\n#### 3 MOTIVATION\n\nLimitation in Quantum Hardwares. Quantum devices are inherently error-prone, and the variability in error rates across different qubits and gates can have a significant impact on the performance of quantum circuits. In a superconducting device, such as IBM ibm_quebec [11], the median Error per Clifford (ECR) error rate is 6.931e-3, a crucial metric for understanding the fidelity of quantum operations, particularly when implementing error correction protocols. The median T1 and T2 time are 284.52 us and 214.31 us respectively. These two metrics indicate how long a qubit can retain its quantum state before it loses energy. It also has other errors, such as state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, crosstalk errors, etc.\n\nThese errors make the execution of quantum programs lose fidelity. The impact of these various errors is exacerbated in deep circuits, where the errors accumulate over many operations and execution time, leading to substantial deviations from the expected outcomes. As a result, minimizing circuit depth and gate count is not just a matter of efficiency but also essential for reducing the overall error rate and enhancing the reliability of quantum computations.\n\nIn addition to the errors in a quantum device, the qubit connection tends to be sparse to avoid crosstalk errors [6, 10, 32]. For\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_2_Figure_9.jpeg</img>\nFigure 3: Qubit Connection in IBM_Quebec.\n</F>\n\nexample, Fig. 3 represents the qubit connection in the ibm_quebec device with readout error in each qubit and ECR error in each connection. Each circle represents a qubit and a link represents where a two-qubit gate could be executed. The color indicates the error variability. A lighter color indicates a higher error rate.\n\nSuch sparse connectivity requires more SWAP gate insertion in the circuit compilation. Those additional SWAP gates increase the gate count, extend the circuit execution, and exacerbate the negative impact of errors in the program execution outcome.\n\nGlobal view in the QAOA compilation. Qubit mapping is a NPhard Problem [18, 26, 30, 39]. The existing generic quantum compilers either leverage SAT solvers [25, 35], which suffer from scalability issues, or use heuristic solutions that do not guarantee the quality of the compilation results [19]. The challenge becomes even more significant in the compilation of the QAOA problem, where gate commutativity can be exploited. Although, some domain-specific compilers for QAOA program are proposed [1, 2, 16], they still face significant drawbacks, such as scalability issues [25, 35] and unexpectedly high compilation costs [1, 17, 20].\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Mahabubul Alam, Abdullah Ash-Saki, et al. 2020.

This concept, introduced by John Preskill in 2012, combines engineering quantum devices with computational complexity theory to find tasks that provide superpolynomial speedup over classical algorithms. Achieving quantum supremacy doesn't require practical applications or high-quality error correction, making it a near-term scientific goal with limited immediate commercial impact. The journey to quantum supremacy has historical roots, from Turing's 1936 universal computing machine to Feynman's 1981 assertion that nature is inherently quantum mechanical. Significant milestones include Shor's 1994 algorithm for integer factorization and Grover's 1996 search algorithm. In the 21st century, progress accelerated with D-Wave's commercial quantum computers and Google's 2019 claim of quantum supremacy with its 53-qubit Sycamore processor. Critics argue over the practicality and error susceptibility of quantum computers, and some object to the term \"quantum supremacy\" due to its connotations. Alternatives like \"quantum advantage\" have gained traction.\n\nThe chunk is: Complexity arguments concern how the amount of some resource needed to solve a problem (generally time or memory) scales with the size of the input. In this setting, a problem consists of an inputted problem instance (a binary string) and returned solution (corresponding output string), while resources refers to designated elementary operations, memory usage, or communication. A collection of local operations allows for the computer to generate the output string. A circuit model and its corresponding operations are useful in describing both classical and quantum problems; the classical circuit model consists of basic operations such as AND gates, OR gates, and NOT gates while the quantum model consists of classical circuits and the application of unitary operations. Unlike the finite set of classical gates, there are an infinite amount of quantum gates due to the continuous nature of unitary operations. In both classical and quantum cases, complexity swells with increasing problem size. As an extension of classical computational complexity theory, quantum complexity theory considers what a theoretical universal quantum computer could accomplish without accounting for the difficulty of building a physical quantum computer or dealing with decoherence and noise. Since quantum information is a generalization of classical information, quantum computers can simulate any classical algorithm.\n\nQuantum complexity classes are sets of problems that share a common quantum computational model, with each model containing specified resource constraints. Circuit models are useful in describing quantum complexity classes. The most useful quantum complexity class is BQP (bounded-error quantum polynomial time), the class of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a universal quantum computer. Questions about BQP still remain, such as the connection between BQP and the polynomial-time hierarchy, whether or not BQP contains NP-complete problems, and the exact lower and upper bounds of the BQP class. Not only would answers to these questions reveal the nature of BQP, but they would also answer difficult classical complexity theory questions. One strategy for better understanding BQP is by defining related classes, ordering them into a conventional class hierarchy, and then looking for properties that are revealed by their relation to BQP. There are several other quantum complexity classes, such as QMA (quantum Merlin Arthur) and QIP (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\nThe difficulty of proving what cannot be done with classical computing is a common problem in definitively demonstrating quantum supremacy. Contrary to decision problems that require yes or no answers, sampling problems ask for samples from probability distributions. If there is a classical algorithm that can efficiently sample from the output of an arbitrary quantum circuit, the polynomial hierarchy would collapse to the third level, which is generally considered to be very unlikely. Boson sampling is a more specific proposal, the classical hardness of which depends upon the intractability of calculating the permanent of a large matrix with complex entries, which is a #P-complete problem. The arguments used to reach this conclusion have been extended to IQP Sampling, where only the conjecture that the average- and worst-case complexities of the problem are the same is needed, as well as to Random Circuit Sampling, which is the task replicated by the Google and UTSC research groups.\n\nProposed experiments \nThe following are proposals for demonstrating quantum computational supremacy using current technology, often called NISQ devices. Such proposals include (1) a well-defined computational problem, (2) a quantum algorithm to solve this problem, (3) a comparison best-case classical algorithm to solve the problem, and (4) a complexity-theoretic argument that, under a reasonable assumption, no classical algorithm can perform significantly better than current algorithms (so the quantum algorithm still provides a superpolynomial speedup).\n\nShor's algorithm for factoring integers\n\nThis algorithm finds the prime factorization of an n-bit integer in  time whereas the best known classical algorithm requires time and the best upper bound for the complexity of this problem is . It can also provide a speedup for any problem that reduces to integer factoring, including the membership problem for matrix groups over fields of odd order.\n\nThis algorithm is important both practically and historically for quantum computing. It was the first polynomial-time quantum algorithm proposed for a real-world problem that is believed to be hard for classical computers. Namely, it gives a superpolynomial speedup under the reasonable assumption that RSA, today's most common encryption protocol, is secure.\n\nFactoring has some benefit over other supremacy proposals because factoring can be checked quickly with a classical computer just by multiplying integers, even for large instances where factoring algorithms are intractably slow. However, implementing Shor's algorithm for large numbers is infeasible with current technology, so it is not being pursued as a strategy for demonstrating supremacy.\n\nBoson sampling\n\nThis computing paradigm based upon sending identical photons through a linear-optical network can solve certain sampling and search problems that, assuming a few complexity-theoretical conjectures (that calculating the permanent of Gaussian matrices is #P-Hard and that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse) are intractable for classical computers. However, it has been shown that boson sampling in a system with large enough loss and noise can be simulated efficiently.\n\nThe largest experimental implementation of boson sampling to date had 6 modes so could handle up to 6 photons at a time. The best proposed classical algorithm for simulating boson sampling runs in time  for a system with n photons and m output modes. BosonSampling is an open-source implementation in R. The algorithm leads to an estimate of 50 photons required to demonstrate quantum supremacy with boson sampling.\n\nSampling the output distribution of random quantum circuits\n\nThe best known algorithm for simulating an arbitrary random quantum circuit requires an amount of time that scales exponentially with the number of qubits, leading one group to estimate that around 50 qubits could be enough to demonstrate quantum supremacy. Bouland, Fefferman, Nirkhe and Vazirani gave, in 2018, theoretical evidence that efficiently simulating a random quantum circuit would require a collapse of the computational polynomial hierarchy. Google had announced its intention to demonstrate quantum supremacy by the end of 2017 by constructing and running a 49-qubit chip that would be able to sample distributions inaccessible to any current classical computers in a reasonable amount of time. The largest universal quantum circuit simulator running on classical supercomputers at the time was able to simulate 48 qubits. But for particular kinds of circuits, larger quantum circuit simulations with 56 qubits are possible. This may require increasing the number of qubits to demonstrate quantum supremacy. On October 23, 2019, Google published the results of this quantum supremacy experiment in the Nature article, \u201cQuantum Supremacy Using a Programmable Superconducting Processor\u201d in which they developed a new 53-qubit processor, named \u201cSycamore\u201d, that is capable of fast, high-fidelity quantum logic gates, in order to perform the benchmark testing. Google claims that their machine performed the target computation in 200 seconds, and estimated that their classical algorithm would take 10,000 years in the world's fastest supercomputer to solve the same problem. IBM disputed this claim, saying that an improved classical algorithm should be able to solve that problem in two and a half days on that same supercomputer.\n\nCriticisms\nSource 9:\n# Synergistic Dynamical Decoupling and Circuit Design for Enhanced Algorithm Performance on Near-Term Quantum Devices\n\nYanjun Ji\u2217 and Ilia Polian\u2020\n\nInstitute of Computer Architecture and Computer Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 47, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany\n\n(Dated: May 28, 2024)\n\nDynamical decoupling (DD) is a promising technique for mitigating errors in near term quantum devices. However, its effectiveness depends on both hardware characteristics and algorithm implementation details. This paper explores the synergistic effects of dynamical decoupling and optimized circuit design in maximizing the performance and robustness of algorithms on near term quantum devices. By utilizing eight IBM quantum devices, we analyze how hardware features and algorithm design impact the effectiveness of DD for error mitigation. Our analysis takes into account factors such as circuit fidelity, scheduling duration, and hardware native gate set. We also examine the influence of algorithmic implementation details including specific gate decompositions, DD sequences, and optimization levels. The results reveal an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of DD and the inherent performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of gate directionality and circuit symmetry in improving performance. This study offers valuable insights for optimizing DD protocols and circuit designs, highlighting the significance of a holistic approach that leverages both hardware features and algorithm design for high quality and reliable execution of near term quantum algorithms.\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nNear-term quantum devices (NISQ) [1] hold immense potential but face hurdles in accuracy and reliability due to inherent noise arising from environmental fluctuations, imperfect gate operations, and qubit interactions. Moreover, limitations in qubit count and connectivity restrict the complexity of achievable quantum circuits. Robust error mitigation techniques [2] are therefore crucial to unlock the full potential of NISQ devices. Dynamical decoupling (DD) [3\u20136] stands out as a powerful approach for NISQ devices due to its simplicity and low resource overhead. It mitigates decoherence errors by applying a carefully designed sequence of control pulses during idle periods of the qubits. These pulses effectively suppress the unwanted interaction between qubits and their environment, protecting the desired quantum state. DD has been demonstrated in various quantum systems including spins [7\u201312], superconducting qubits [5, 13, 14], and trapped ions [15]. The effectiveness of DD extends beyond decoherence suppression, as it can also mitigate crosstalk [13, 16] and coherent errors [17].\n\nNumerous DD sequences have been developed, with prominent examples including the Carr-Purcell (CP) [18], Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) [19], XY4 [20\u201323], KDD [24], and Uhrig dynamical decoupling (UDD) [25]. However, the effectiveness of different sequences varies significantly [26]. Prior work has shown that the CPMG sequence outperforms the CP sequence [4]. Additionally, higher-order sequences generally outperform lower order sequences [4, 26], but optimizing pulse intervals within CPMG and XY4 sequences can achieve comparable performance [26]. In the context of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) [27\u201331], DD sequences like CP, CPMG, and XY4 significantly enhance performance, while KDD showed worse performance on IBM quantum processing units (QPUs) [32]. Combining DD sequences with pulse-level optimization in QAOA can further improve performance [32]. While DD sequences mitigate errors, these additional control pulses can also introduce errors such as gate infidelities or crosstalk. To address this trade-off, adaptive approaches have been explored [33], which estimate the potential benefit of DD for each qubit combination and selectively apply DD to the subset that offers the most benefit. Furthermore, recent work has explored the use of empirical learning schemes for enhancing DD effectiveness on quantum processors [34], leveraging data-driven techniques to optimize the implementation of DD sequences, leading to improved error suppression capabilities.\n\nDespite extensive research on DD sequences, most studies neglect the crucial role of algorithm implementation details such as transpilation efficiency [35\u201338], circuit structure, and gate decompositions [39]. This work addresses this gap by examining the factors influencing DD sequence effectiveness, emphasizing the critical role of algorithm implementation details in enhancing overall performance. We focus on the CPMG sequence due to its well-established effectiveness, robustness [4], and good performance for QAOA on IBM QPUs [32].\n\nThe study explores how hardware characteristics and algorithm design affect the effectiveness of DD for error mitigation on near term quantum devices by analyzing different implementations of the QAOA on eight IBM QPUs. Our findings reveal an inverse relationship between the initial performance of the algorithm without DD and the effectiveness of DD. While DD generally\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> yanjun.ji@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de\n\n<sup>\u2020</sup> ilia.polian@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de\n\nenhances performance and robustness, circuits with inherently higher fidelity and shorter execution times benefit less from DD than those with lower initial performance. Moreover, factors such as hardware native gates of QPUs, chosen gate decomposition strategy, and optimization level can also influence the effectiveness of DD. Additionally, using gates with consistent directionality and maintaining circuit symmetry during design lead to improved performance. These findings emphasize the importance of a holistic approach that considers both hardware and software optimization for the successful execution of algorithms with DD on NISQ devices, providing valuable insights for optimizing DD protocols and designing more robust quantum algorithms.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section II outlines the methodology, presenting the benchmark circuits and metrics used to evaluate algorithm performance. Hardware considerations and a proposed synergistic design approach combining both hardware and algorithmic factors are also described. Section III then analyzes results, exploring the impact of various hardware factors including circuit fidelity, schedule duration, and native gate sets, as well as algorithmic factors including different implementations, DD sequences, and optimization levels. Finally, Sec. IV discusses the key findings and concludes.\n\n#### II. METHODOLOGY\nSource 10:\n## D. Crosstalk Error Model Comparison\n\nTable I shows the detailed crosstalk error model for two different IBM quantum devices in terms of machine, number of qubits (#Qubit), quantum volume (QV), processor, crosstalk mode, and topology.\n\nWithin the IBM Lima architecture, a Falcon r4T configuration contains five qubits carefully arranged in a T topology connectivity. Contrary to expectations, the crosstalk error model exhibited by these arrangements surpasses that observed for the IBM Nairobi device. It is noteworthy that despite the modest number of qubits (just five) and a quantum volume of eight, the Falcon r4T configuration on IBM Lima experiences a significantly more pronounced crosstalk error. The severity of the crosstalk error on this machine is approximately 2.5x greater than that encountered on the IBM Nairobi.\n\nAlthough the new Falcon r5.1H IBM Nairobi processor boasts a configuration of seven qubits, a standout attribute is its remarkable reduction in crosstalk errors. Adding to its technical capability, this processor is ingeniously arranged as an H processor type with higher levels of connectivity. The driving force behind this notable achievement lies in the quantum volume, which reaches an impressive 32. This substantial increase in quantum volume translates into a significant enhancement of error rates, particularly for crosstalk errors.\n\nAfter we analyze the comparison between the IBM Lima 5 and IBM Nairobi 7 devices, it is evident that the selection of a specific device holds significant importance in the execution of various operations, notably in terms of quantum error mitigation (QEM) and quantum error correction (QEC). This comparison emphasizes the critical role that the choice of a quantum device plays in ensuring the efficacy and success of operations that involve error mitigation and correction within the quantum computing paradigm.\n\n## E. Impact of Crosstalk Error on Circuit Fidelity\n\nFinally, we evaluate the crosstalk error for the most severe IBM Nairobi to determine its effect on the circuit fidelity. We choose four benchmarks from [53] like grover n2, toffoli n3, cat state n4, and Ipn n5 with the different numbers of qubits and gates per benchmark. We prepare all experimental benchmarks at optimization level 0, which is no optimization for the simulation to determine the real effect of crosstalk error. The baseline is no simultaneous CNOTs (no crosstalk) with the experimental benchmarks.\n\nFigure 6 shows the impact of the crosstalk error of the Probability of Success Trails (PST) on the small-scale benchmarks of 2-5 qubits on the IBM Nairobi 7-qubits device. PST is the real system success probability of the number of trails with the correct measurement result divided by the total number of trails when executing on the real simulation. The probability of obtaining the right output state decreases with an increase in simultaneous CNOTs due to the inserted crosstalk error. Inserting the crosstalk error decreases the PST by 1.85x on average (up to 3.06x) based on the noise model of the tested pair. This experimental result is based on the highest crosstalk error pair in the crosstalk error model for the IBM Nairobi.\n\nIn the case of grover n1, the fidelity decreases by 44.05% compared with the non-crosstalk case. When we compare the presence of a barrier with no barrier in terms of output fidelity, the fidelity is improved by 2.06x. In the best case of toffoli n3, the fidelity decreases by 30.54% and improves by 3.06x when a barrier is inserted. In the worst case, such as for cat state n4, the fidelity decreases by 48.35% compared with the non-crosstalk case. In our comparison in terms of output fidelity and circuit depth with and without a barrier, the fidelity improves by 1.87x. With Ipn n5, the fidelity decreases by 40.21% with an improvement of 2.3x after the barrier is inserted.\n\nAs we can see from the figure above, the insertion of a barrier results in an improvement in output fidelity up to almost the same level as that of no crosstalk errors. Consequently, this work may lead to a greater interest in QEM techniques in the future.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_7_Figure_9.jpeg</img>\nFIG. 6: Probability of Success Trails (PST) for four benchmarks under different conditions with only CNOT gate, with simultaneous CNOT gates, and with barriers along with simultaneous CNOT gates.\n</F>\n\n## VI. DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS\n\nA recent trend in QEM techniques [54] is to exploit greater potential from the crosstalk error with a greater number of mitigation opportunities. Unlike innovations that are mostly driven by the underlying technologies, our study takes the first profound direction which is to enable a deeper understanding of the crosstalk error model for different devices by leveraging the RB and SRB protocols. Relatively little attention has been paid to this approach for two main reasons: 1) it is exceedingly difficult to extract useful information from a large number of circuit and gate sequences, which is the accurate level at which most operations today operate, and 2) the scalability of the protocol on all different devices, which is an effective static analysis of a protocol, becomes quite difficult as the size of the operation matrix grows exponentially with the number of qubits. We believe that these are two critical yet difficult problems in the understanding of crosstalk error characteristics because they prevent the quantum operation from performing correctly.\n\nLimited Value on a Realistic System: As the data are limited on realistic systems, specific details about the current state of IBM's quantum devices and their performance with real-world data may not be available to all researchers. The progress made by and specifications for quantum devices is continuously evolving as research and development in quantum computing advance. To obtain the most accurate and up-to-date information about IBM's quantum devices, including any limited crosstalk error from real systems, we used a fake device that mimics a real system. Additionally, due to the expensive runtime\n\n9\n\n<T>\n| Machine | #Qubits | QV | Processors | Crosstalk Mode | EP GRB1 | EP GRB2 | EP GSRB | Topology |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| IBM Lima | 5 | 8 | Falcon r4T | Minor | 0.004 | 0.026 | 1.2 |  |\n|  |  |  |  | Medium | 0.007 | 0.023 | 3.4 |  |\n|  |  |  |  | Severe | 0.010 | 0.037 | 5.6 |  |\n| IBM Nairobi | 7 | 32 | Falcon r5.11H | Minor | 0.006 | 0.006 | 1.6 |  |\n|  |  |  |  | Medium | 0.0075 | 0.009 | 2.15 |  |\n|  |  |  |  | Severe | 0.009 | 0.012 | 2.7 |  |\n</T>\n\nTABLE I: Characteristics of IBM quantum devices used in our study, IBM Lima and IBM Nairobi.

QEC is paramount, and it demands additional qubits and computational resources. The challenges include mitigating decoherence and environmental interactions, reducing error rates, ensuring scalability while managing noise, improving quantum hardware, and refining noise models for accurate characterization. Strategies such as hybrid quantum-classical approaches may serve to address these challenges, as the field focuses on building robust, scalable quantum computers that are capable of handling errors effectively and enabling practical quantum information processing. However, our study experiments with the current NISQ devices, which have a different way of handling errors to explore more in the practical QIP."

      "response_tokens": 1774,
      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to design a flash loan arbitrage strategy that takes advantage of price differences across different DeFi DEXs. Hmm, first off, I need to understand what exactly flash loan arbitrage is. From what I remember, it's when you take advantage of temporary market imbalances or price discrepancies between two assets on the same platform. But wait, in this case, it's multiple DEXs, so maybe there are several platforms offering different tokens or products.\n\nI think the main goal here is to find these price differences and then exploit them without being exposed to systemic risks. But how do I account for gas costs and slippage? Oh right, those are costs when you trade on a blockchain network, like Ethereum. The more you move your token's price, the more \"gas\" it costs to do so, which reduces your profit.\n\nSo, let me break this down. Each DEX might have different liquidation times for their tokens. Maybe some are longer-term and others are short-term. If I can find a DEX that is selling at a higher price than another that's only available in the near future, I could lock up my position to buy it at a lower price when it's out of trade. That way, even if there are gas costs or slippage, I still make a profit.\n\nWait, but how do I compare across DEXs? Each DEX might have their own price dynamics and gas costs. So maybe I should look for pairs where the cross-chain price is significantly different compared to the base chain. For example, if the token on the main chain (like Cardano) has a certain price, another token from another chain like Solana could be selling much higher or lower.\n\nI also need to think about volatility and how gas costs affect each trade. High gas costs can make any small profit into nothing. So I should balance this by only taking profits when there's significant price movement and enough volume remains until the liquidation date. That way, even with slippage, the overall impact is manageable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is market timing. If I'm going to take advantage of a temporary imbalance, it needs to be during the right time\u2014before liquidation deadlines. So maybe I should look for DEXs that have liquidation times around the same period where my position could exit if I make the trade.\n\nI should also think about how different DEXs might adjust their prices in response to each other. For instance, if one DEX sells a token at $10 with high gas costs and another chain's token is at $5, but the base price drops due to gas costs, I need to see if I can recoup my profit before it goes down.\n\nI wonder about the implementation details. How often would this strategy be tested? And how do I manage risk when liquidating quickly without risking too much? Maybe using stop-loss orderings or adjusting positions based on live price data as it changes.\n\nAlso, what are some examples of DEXs that trade similar tokens across platforms? For example, maybe Solana and Cardano both trade Cardano. If they're at different prices, that could be exploited. But I have to account for gas costs when comparing the two.\n\nI should probably outline a step-by-step approach. First, analyze the price history of all DEXs involved to spot cross-chain imbalances. Then, identify which pairs have significant price differences and look for liquidation opportunities. Next, monitor gas costs and slippage during trade periods and adjust positions accordingly. Finally, test the strategy regularly and manage risk through diversification and stop-loss mechanisms.\n\nWait, but what about the computational cost of multiple DEXs? Each DEX might have its own layer 2 networks or blockchains with different complexities. That could affect how easily you can liquidate your position after a trade if it's not settled quickly enough. So maybe looking for a base chain that's highly complex and allows quick settlement while the cross-chain tokens are less settled.\n\nI also need to consider the efficiency of each DEX's price discovery mechanisms. If one DEX uses more advanced algorithms or has better data sources, their prices might be more reliable and less affected by gas costs during trading periods.\n\nSo putting it all together: first, identify cross-chain pairs with significant price differences. Then, set up trade points where I can take advantage of those imbalances without liquidating too soon to avoid slippage issues. During trade, monitor gas costs on each DEX, especially the base chain and any layer 2 networks used by other DEXs, and adjust my positions or stop-loss thresholds as needed. Test the strategy regularly, perhaps using multiple DEXs in the same region, to ensure it's robust across different liquidation times.\n\nI think that covers most of the bases. Now, how would this translate into a concrete strategy? Maybe focusing on a specific pair where one token is much cheaper or more expensive than another. For example, if Solana-based Cardano is selling at $20 and the main chain's Cardano is at $15, but due to gas costs, the price drops by 5% over an hour, I would look to take a flash loan in Solana before it hits its liquidation date.\n\nI should also consider writing a \"take\" on one DEX and \"buy\" or \"sell\" on another. That way, if the base chain's token is out of trade when I make the trade, I can recoup my profit even with slippage in between.\n\nWait, but what about multiple pairs? Maybe using some kind of network effect where taking advantage of one pair allows me to take advantage of others more easily. Or perhaps a bet on cross-chain price parity. That could be tricky because if two DEXs are both trying to exploit the same imbalance, it might create an internal price bubble.\n\nI also need to think about the computational overhead. If I have multiple transactions at once, how does that affect gas costs? Maybe using layer 2 strategies to minimize this cost.\n\nAnother thought: maybe using a combination of DEXs where some are cheaper and others are more expensive, so when one goes out of trade, another can come into play to take advantage of the price difference. But I have to be cautious about creating multiple risks or relying on only one platform's performance.\n\nOverall, it's a complex strategy that requires careful monitoring, managing multiple variables like gas costs and slippage, and ensuring risk management through proper position sizes and liquidation strategies.\n</think>\n\n**Flash Loan Arbitrage Strategy Across Multiple DEXs**\n\n**1.

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this paper about repositioning intensity and liquidity concentration on DEXs. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions centralized exchanges (CEXs) like FTX, which keep all client funds, including deposits, with them. That makes sense because they can match orders and record everything in the limit order book. But then there are decentralized exchanges (DEXs), like Uniswap, where users own their assets entirely on the exchange.\n\nThe paper talks about how DEXs offer higher security because you don't have to rely on a third party for custody. Instead, each user's funds are on the blockchain. However, this comes at a cost\u2014gas fees. These are extra costs incurred when executing trades, both from liquidity demanders and LPs.\n\nLPs (like Uniswap) pay gas fees whenever they reposition their positions in the limit order book. Repositioning is like moving up or down on the chart to execute trades. The idea here is that more frequent repositioning means better protection against being \"adverse selected\"\u2014which I think refers to traders who have bad information about price changes. So, by moving frequently, LPs can avoid these issues and get better execution.\n\nThe paper argues that higher repositioning (more often) leads to more concentration of liquidity around the market price because LPs are adjusting their positions in real-time. This concentration reduces slippage, which is bad for traders who want fast trades. Lower concentration would mean higher slippage, making it harder to get liquid quotes quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, if gas fees are high (meaning you can't reposition often), you have to wait longer or have a wider price range to avoid being adverse selected. This leads to less concentration because you're not adjusting your positions as frequently.\n\nBut the tricky part is that repositioning intensity is endogenous\u2014meaning it depends on other factors, like gas fees and the current liquidity concentration. If LPs adjust their repositioning based on these factors, there might be a lot of uncertainty about how much they'll do each time.\n\nThe paper's main point seems to be that higher repositioning leads to better market performance by reducing slippage. However, this effect is influenced by the cost of gas fees and the current state of liquidity in the pool, which complicates the picture because it introduces more variables into the equation.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how the authors measure these factors, but I think they might use something like gas fees as a variable that affects LPs' repositioning intensity. If gas fees are low, LPs can adjust often, leading to higher concentration and better performance. But if gas fees are high or liquidity is too concentrated, this could go the other way.\n\nI also wonder how this compares to traditional market makers. In traditional markets, you might have more predictable price movements because they're based on actual events, whereas DEXs rely solely on the blockchain, which can be less predictable. This uncertainty might contribute to the higher costs associated with gas fees and liquidity concentration.\n\nOverall, the paper seems to suggest that managing repositioning intensity is crucial for improving liquidity in DEXs, but it's a delicate balance because multiple factors are at play.\n</think>\n\nThe paper discusses the impact of repositioning intensity on liquidity concentration on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by analyzing how frequent position adjustments affect market performance and risk. Here's a structured summary:\n\n1. **CEX vs. DEX Context**:\n   - CEXs like FTX maintain funds with a centralized limit order book, offering speed but higher costs due to gas fees.\n   - DEXs like Uniswap allow users to keep their assets on the blockchain, reducing these costs. LPs (like Uniswap) adjust positions in real-time, paying gas fees for each update.\n\n2. **Repositioning Intensity**:\n   - Repositioning refers to how often LPs adjust their liquid positions. More frequent repositioning enhances protection against adverse selection by avoiding price deviations.\n   - The paper argues that higher intensity leads to better market performance (lower slippage) due to reduced uncertainty in liquidity.\n\n3. **Gas Fees and Liquidity Concentration**:\n   - High gas fees reduce repositioning frequency, potentially leading to wider price ranges to avoid adverse selection.\n   - Lower frequency results in more concentration, increasing slippage.\n\n4. **Endogeneity Considerations**:\n   - LPs' decision-making is influenced by gas fees and liquidity concentration, adding complexity to the relationship between repositioning intensity and performance.\n\n5. **Comparison with Traditional Markets**:\n   - DEXs rely on blockchain security but face uncertainty from gas fees and liquidity concentration, unlike traditional markets which may offer more predictable price movements.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Higher repositioning intensity can improve market outcomes by reducing slippage but is influenced by multiple factors like gas fees and liquidity concentration.\n   - The paper highlights the delicate balance needed for effective DEX performance, emphasizing the importance of managing repositioning carefully.",
      "context": "Source 1:\n\nSource 2:\nArbitrage in economics and finance involves exploiting price differences of the same asset across different markets or forms to generate profit. The ideal arbitrage is risk-free, with no negative cash flow and a guaranteed positive outcome. It leads to price convergence across markets, promoting market efficiency. Arbitrage can occur in various forms, such as spatial arbitrage (geographical), merger arbitrage (takeover speculation), municipal bond arbitrage, convertible bond arbitrage, and cross-border arbitrage (different stock prices in different countries). Despite its benefits, arbitrage carries risks, including execution risk, counterparty risk, and liquidity risk, especially during financial crises. Notable examples include the downfall of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 due to fixed income arbitrage failures and regulatory arbitrage, where entities exploit regulatory inconsistencies for profit, sometimes leading to increased systemic risk.\n\nThe chunk is: For instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond, then sell fixed income securities or interest rate futures (to hedge the interest rate exposure) and buy some credit protection (to hedge the risk of credit deterioration).\nEventually what he or she would be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock, acquired at a very low price.\nHe or she could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or delta hedging his or her exposure to the underlying shares.\n\nDepository receipts\nA depositary receipt is a security that is offered as a \"tracking stock\" on another foreign market. For instance, a Chinese company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the New York Stock Exchange, as the amount of capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs (American depositary receipt) or GDRs (global depository receipt) depending on where they are issued, are typically considered \"foreign\" and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. Many ADR's are exchangeable into the original security (known as fungibility) and actually have the same value. In this case, there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Other ADR's that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However, there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it one can hedge that risk.\n\nCross-border arbitrage\nCross-border arbitrage exploits different prices of the same stock in different countries:\n\nExample: Apple is trading on NASDAQ at US$108.84. The stock is also traded on the German electronic exchange, XETRA. If 1 euro costs US$1.11, a cross-border trader could enter a buy order on the XETRA at \u20ac98.03 per Apple share and a sell order at \u20ac98.07 per share.\n\nSome brokers in Germany do not offer access to the U.S. exchanges. Hence if a German retail investor wants to buy Apple stock, he needs to buy it on the XETRA. The cross-border trader would sell the Apple shares on XETRA to the investor and buy the shares in the same second on NASDAQ. Afterwards, the cross-border trader would need to transfer the shares bought on NASDAQ to the German XETRA exchange, where he is obliged to deliver the stock.\n\nIn most cases, the quotation on the local exchanges is done electronically by high-frequency traders, taking into consideration the home price of the stock and the exchange rate. This kind of high-frequency trading benefits the public, as it reduces the cost to the German investor and enables them to buy U.S. shares.\n\nDual-listed companies\nA dual-listed company (DLC) structure involves two companies incorporated in different countries contractually agreeing to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise, while retaining their separate legal identity and existing stock exchange listings. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the twin pair should move in lockstep. In practice, DLC share prices exhibit large deviations from theoretical parity. Arbitrage positions in DLCs can be set up by obtaining a long position in the relatively underpriced part of the DLC and a short position in the relatively overpriced part. Such arbitrage strategies start paying off as soon as the relative prices of the two DLC stocks converge toward theoretical parity. However, since there is no identifiable date at which DLC prices will converge, arbitrage positions sometimes have to be kept open for considerable periods of time. In the meantime, the price gap might widen. In these situations, arbitrageurs may receive margin calls, after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss. Arbitrage in DLCs may be profitable, but is also very risky.\n\nA good illustration of the risk of DLC arbitrage is the position in Royal Dutch Shell\u2014which had a DLC structure until 2005\u2014by the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM, see also the discussion below). Lowenstein (2000)  describes that LTCM established an arbitrage position in Royal Dutch Shell in the summer of 1997, when Royal Dutch traded at an 8 to 10 percent premium. In total, $2.3 billion was invested, half of which was long in Shell and the other half was short in Royal Dutch (Lowenstein, p.\u00a099). In the autumn of 1998, large defaults on Russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and LTCM had to unwind several positions. Lowenstein reports that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22 percent and LTCM had to close the position and incur a loss. According to Lowenstein (p.\u00a0234), LTCM lost $286 million in equity pairs trading and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the Royal Dutch Shell trade. (See further under Limits to arbitrage.)\n\nPrivate to public equities\nThe market prices for privately held companies are typically viewed from a return on investment perspective (such as 25%), whilst publicly held and or exchange listed companies trade on a Price to earnings ratio (P/E) (such as a P/E of 10, which equates to a 10% ROI). Thus, if a publicly traded company specialises in the acquisition of privately held companies, from a per-share perspective there is a gain with every acquisition that falls within these guidelines. E.g., Berkshire Hathaway. Private to public equities arbitrage is a term that can arguably be applied to investment banking in general.  Private markets to public markets differences may also help explain the overnight windfall gains enjoyed by principals of companies that just did an initial public offering (IPO).\n\nRegulatory arbitrage\n\nRegulatory arbitrage \"is an avoidance strategy of regulation that is exercised as a result of a regulatory inconsistency\". In other words, where a regulated institution takes advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) risk and the regulatory position. For example, if a bank, operating under the Basel I accord, has to hold 8% capital against default risk, but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to securitise the loan, removing the low-risk loan from its portfolio. On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately. Regulatory arbitrage can result in parts of entire businesses being unregulated as a result of the arbitrage.\n\nThis process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime, as described by Alan Greenspan in his October 1998 speech on The Role of Capital in Optimal Banking Supervision and Regulation.\n\nThe term \"Regulatory Arbitrage\" was used for the first time in 2005 when it was applied by Scott V. Simpson, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, to refer to a new defence tactic in hostile mergers and acquisitions where differing takeover regimes in deals involving multi-jurisdictions are exploited to the advantage of a target company under threat.\nSource 3:\n# Blockchain scaling and liquidity concentration on decentralized exchanges \u2217\n\nBasile Caparros\u2020 , Amit Chaudhary\u2021 , Olga Klein\u00a7\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\n#### Abstract\n\nLiquidity providers (LPs) on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) can protect themselves from adverse selection risk by updating their positions more frequently. However, repositioning is costly, because LPs have to pay gas fees for each update. We analyze the causal relation between repositioning and liquidity concentration around the market price, using the entry of blockchain scaling solutions, Arbitrum and Polygon, as our instruments. Lower gas fees on scaling solutions allow LPs to update more frequently than on Ethereum. Our results demonstrate that higher repositioning intensity and precision lead to greater liquidity concentration, which benefits small trades by reducing their slippage.\n\n### JEL classifications: G14, G18, G19\n\nKeywords: decentralized exchanges, FinTech, gas fees, liquidity concentration, market depth, slippage\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup>We would like to thank Marius Zoican, Alfred Lehar, Gleb Kurovskiy, Fahad Saleh, Norman Sch\u00a8urhoff, Andrea Barbon, Fay\u00b8cal Drissi, Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, Roman Kozhan, Nir Chemaya, Dingyue Liu, Peter O'Neill and seminar participants at Warwick Business School, Gillmore Center for Financial Technology, UCSB-ECON DeFi Seminar, World Federation of Exchanges and Oxford-Man Institute (OMI) Finance Seminar for insightful comments on this paper.

Crucially, FTX kept custody of its client deposits. Thus, whereas the exact reasons for its collapse were the subject of investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), at least $1B of its customers' funds have vanished, according to Reuters1 . FTX was a centralized exchange (CEX), with all trades taking place through a limit order book (LOB). In any LOB-based market, a central institution, such as FTX, is needed to match trades and keep records of all transactions.\n\nA recent alternative to CEXs are so-called decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that operate directly on the blockchain. In contrast to CEXs, users themselves keep custody of their assets on DEXs. They execute their trades directly from their wallet, using smart contracts, i.e. a set of pre-programmed rules.2 Therefore, executing directly on the blockchain provides higher level of security for clients' funds. Indeed, there is evidence of significant trading volume shifting to DEXs in the week of FTX collapse. According to Reuters, \"volumes at the largest DEX, Uniswap, spiked to $17.2 billion in the week of Nov 6-13, from just over $6 billion the week before\".3\n\nThis higher level of security on DEXs comes, however, at a cost. First, transactions are overall slower, since they have to be validated by \"miners\" or \"validators\" before being recorded on the blockchain. Second, users of the blockchain have to compensate validators with the so-called \"gas fees\" for their efforts. Importantly, \"gas fees\" are paid not only by liquidity demanders, but also by liquidity providers (LPs). Essentially, gas fees represent\n\n<sup>1&</sup>quot;Exclusive: At least $1 billion of client funds missing at failed crypto firm FTX\", Reuters, November 13, 2022.

(2021) also argue that decentralized exchanges have higher security, because assets are never transferred to the custody of a third party. Lehar and Parlour (2021) and Barbon and Ranaldo (2021) provide a comprehensive overview of differences between CEXs and DEXs. However, allowing users to keep custody of their own assets is the most important advantage of DEXs.\n\n<sup>3&</sup>quot;Cryptoverse: Let's talk about DEX, baby\", Reuters, November 22, 2022.

Liquidity demanders pay gas fees whenever they would like to execute a trade.4 Liquidity providers pay gas fees whenever they deposit or withdraw liquidity from the exchange.\n\nIn this paper, we analyze the effects of repositioning intensity, i.e. frequency of position updates by LPs, on liquidity concentration on the largest DEX, Uniswap v3. Much alike traditional market makers, LPs are subject to adverse selection risk (). To protect themselves from being adversely selected, LPs need to update their positions in response to changes in the market price, similar to canceling and reposting limit orders in the LOB. With lower gas fees, it is cheaper for LPs to update their liquidity positions. Consequently, they can reposition more frequently, which results in better protection from adverse selection.5 With better protection from adverse selection, LPs can earn higher fees (for the same amount of capital deposited) by setting narrower price ranges around the market price, i.e. their positions become more concentrated. Thus, we expect that a higher repositioning intensity by LPs leads to higher concentration of aggregate liquidity around the market price.\n\nIn contrast, if gas fees are high, LPs should only update their positions if the market price sufficiently deviates from their position's price range, as repositioning is costly. Therefore, we expect LPs to set wider price ranges when they are not able to update frequently, in order to reduce adverse selection risk. Lower repositioning intensity should thus result in lower concentration of aggregate liquidity in the pool. Overall, concentration of aggregate pool liquidity around the market price is important, because higher liquidity concentration translates into lower slippage and thus lower execution cost for traders.\n\nTesting the empirical relation between repositioning intensity and liquidity concentration might be problematic, because repositioning intensity is potentially endogenous. A choice of an LP to update their position can in itself depend on the current liquidity concentration in"

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to explain how zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be used in DeFi to make transactions private without breaking any laws. Hmm, let me start by recalling what ZKPs are. They're cryptographic protocols that allow one party to prove to another that they know a secret without revealing the secret itself. That's pretty cool because it helps protect privacy.\n\nDeFi is decentralized finance, so things like smart contracts and NFTs are common. But how do ZKPs fit into those? Well, DeFi transactions are where users send or receive crypto assets, right? So, if I'm using ZKPs here, the party receiving money shouldn't know that it's coming in through an escrow channel. That makes sense for privacy.\n\nI remember something about confidential transactions being a key term here. Confidentiality means only the parties involved are aware of what's happening. How does that work with ZKPs? Oh right, when a user initiates a transaction, they can prove to the platform they're using to verify ownership without revealing the funds themselves. So the user creates a transaction and uses ZKP proofs to convince the system it's legitimate.\n\nBut wait, how do these transactions actually happen in DeFi? I think there's something called confidential blockchains. They combine transparent smart contracts with privacy. The smart contract would handle the payment, but it can't be seen until proven true by ZKPs. That way, users don't know they're receiving money until the transaction is verified.\n\nLending and borrowing are common DeFi activities. If I use ZKPs here, when someone lends funds, they should prove that they're honest to the platform without revealing their actual balance. Similarly, when they borrow, proving it's done honestly keeps things secure. The transactions would be conducted over a blockchain where only the parties know the details.\n\nI also recall something about privacy tokens. These are designed so users can't track how their funds move, even if there are third-party intermediaries. ZKPs help protect that by allowing the transaction to proceed without revealing who or what is involved, thus keeping it private and compliant with regulations like the PCI DSS.\n\nWhat about NFTs? They're digital assets that aren't tied to physical tokens, which gives more privacy. Using ZKPs in this context could ensure that transactions are secure and transparent for both parties, even if there's no one in between.\n\nI think about escrow systems again. The idea is that someone holds onto the funds temporarily while they verify the transaction through a third party. Once verified, the funds are transferred without any party knowing how they arrived at them. This keeps everything private but ensures compliance with regulations by having a clear chain of events.\n\nPutting it all together, ZKPs in DeFi help create transactions that are both private and compliant. They use confidential blockchains and smart contracts to handle payments securely. This way, users can trade without fearing their funds being exposed or tracked, which is crucial for both security and legal compliance.\n</think>\n\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic protocols that enable one party to prove they know a secret without revealing it. In DeFi, ZKPs enhance transaction privacy while maintaining compliance:\n\n1. **Confidential Transactions**: Each party proves the transaction's legitimacy using ZKP, ensuring only participants are aware of the flow.\n\n2. ** confidential Blockchains**: Combines transparency with privacy through smart contracts that handle payments securely and privately until proven true by ZKPs.\n\n3. **Lending and Borrowing**: Transactions are conducted over a blockchain where proofs verify honesty among parties, keeping funds private.\n\n4. **Privacy Tokens**: Protect users' asset movements without intermediaries, ensuring compliance with regulations like PCI DSS.\n\n5. **Escrow Systems**: Temporarily hold funds for verification by third-party verifiers, transferring them securely after proof.\n\n6. **NFTs**: Use ZKPs in digital assets to ensure secure and transparent transactions between parties without intermediaries.\n\nThis approach ensures both privacy and regulatory compliance in DeFi transactions through secure, transparent, and verified processes."

It seems like it's a study or project report, and the title mentions something called \"MiMC.\" MiMC stands for Modular Inversion-based Multi-Cycle Cryptography, which sounds familiar from some cryptography topics I've heard of before. \n\nThe document starts with an introduction that probably sets up why someone would want to look into this. It mentions ZK-friendly hash functions and zero-knowledge proofs. I remember hearing about zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, which are two types of zero-knowledge proofs.

I think hardware acceleration is important because it can speed up computations, making systems faster and more efficient.\n\nThey also mention other related work like Feistel structures for MPC, elliptic curves, and scalable zero-knowledge proofs.

Distributed ledger technology offers several advantages for banking and finance industry, including efficient transaction processing and cross-party transaction reconciliation. The key challenges for adoption of this technology in financial institutes are (a) the building of a privacy-preserving ledger, (b) supporting auditing and regulatory requirements, and (c) flexibility to adapt to complex use-cases with multiple digital assets and actors. This paper proposes a framework\u2020 . for a private, audit-able, and distributed ledger (PADL) that adapts easily to fundamental use-cases within financial institutes PADL employs widely-used cryptography schemes combined with zero-knowledge proofs to propose a transaction scheme for a 'table' like ledger. It enables fast confidential peer-to-peer multi-asset transactions, and transaction graph anonymity, in a no-trust setup, but with customized privacy. We prove that integrity and anonymity of PADL is secured against a strong threat model. Furthermore, we showcase three fundamental real-life usecases, namely, an assets exchange ledger, a settlement ledger, and a bond market ledger. Based on these use-cases we show that PADL supports smooth-lined inter-assets auditing while preserving privacy of the participants. For example, we show how a bank can be audited for its liquidity or credit risk without violation of privacy of itself or any other party, or how can PADL ensures honest coupon rate payment in bond market without sharing investors values. Finally, our evaluation shows PADL's advantage in performance against previous relevant schemes.\n\nKeywords: Distributed Ledger, Privacy, De-Fi, Zero-knowledge Proofs, Smart Contract, Blockchain, Multi-assets Ledger\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nBlockchain and distributed ledgers technology has opened-up a new form of financial interaction, to transact with no requirement of mediator bodies. The impact is clearly evident in the continuous growth of public blockchain domains such as Bitcoin [31], Ethereum [39] and other ledgers based on smart contract platforms, notably HyperLedger [3]. For financial industry, which is originally\n\n<sup>*</sup> These authors contributed equally to this work\n\n<sup>\u2020</sup> PADL-source-code\n\ncentralized, adapting distributed ledger technology potentially offers several advantages, such as reducing efforts involved in settlement and post-trades processing, streamlining laborious auditing processes, shifting to cloud environments, and enabling nearly instant approval of transactions. However, the current public blockchain ecosystem does not necessarily match the needs of financial institutions that must comply with government regulations and laws. A specific example is that of privacy: public blockchains requires that all participants have access to the transaction for its validation. This is unacceptable (or even illegal) to majority of institutions that require their clients' personal information or trading strategy be kept private and safe.\n\nIn recent years the focus on 'private' blockchains has increased to address concerns on privacy in public blockchain, which are considered only pseudoanonymous. Privacy may be enhanced on blockchain by encrypting or anonymizing certain information, for example, the transaction's values, participants addresses, type of assets, or transaction graph. Inevitably though, encryption of information adds to the complexity of transaction validation and auditing. While encryption may help with enabling private transaction, it makes it nearly impossible for financial institutions to meet trading requirements or answer auditor's queries without revealing sensitive information.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) introduced as interactive [18] or non-interactive protocols (NIZK) [8] between a prover and verifier to convince the truth of a statement without revealing any further information. This technology can be used in private ledger to validate integrity of transactions and answer auditor queries without revealing sensitive information. ZKP systems have seen rapid advancements, particularly in terms of efficiency [19], succinctness, and general applicability. These developments build upon foundational frameworks such as zk-SNARKs [6] and extend to transparent systems that do not require a trusted setup, such as zk-STARKs [5], Ligero [7,2], and Bulletproofs [9]. One of the primary advantages of modern proof systems is their ability to produce short proofs and facilitate the batching verification of range proofs, which demonstrate that a hidden value lies within a specified interval. Evidently, these frameworks can be combined with public blockchains to enhance the privacy of these blockchains with ZKP [35,38]. However current efforts focused on public blockchains fail to address institutions or enterprise blockchain applications that have a different set of auditing and privacy requirements or constraints that are not the focus of public crypto-assets. In practice, it is also recognized that adapting to new cryptography tools may require far more time in a regulated environment where security vulnerability cannot be compromised. Finally, financial industry usecases involve multiple actors and multiple assets or asset-type in the trade or transaction. Existing public blockchain hardly address the issue of maintaining or exchanging multiple assets, not to mention, inter-asset auditing or customizing privacy. Hence, a private distributed ledger for financial institutions must be considerate of the following requirements:\n\nAuditing. Auditing inevitably requires disclosing information to assess and limit the financial and security risks institutes possess. Auditing in a private ledger can be divided into two types. First is privacy preserving auditing which does not require violating privacy of other participants (if they are not directly involved). In this optimal private auditing, a prover shares a ZKP to convince an auditor with the information encrypted to ensure; traceability, transaction integrity, or regulating trading requirements. This privacy preserving auditing would open-up in future the capability to audit financial institutes without laborious efforts or book disclosure, for example, maintaining level of capital at risk in a confidential multi-assets ledgers as we show here. Additionally, some regulations require opening all values. Hence 'full' auditing in essence, letting only a specified party, the capability to open an encrypted value. The requirement here is that this type of auditing should be limited to the specified party. We later discuss the case of a 'settlement bank', where tracing values can be done by a settlement bank for 'full' auditing.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [2] S. Ames, C. Hazay, Y.

PRELIMINARIES\n\n# *A. Zero-Knowledge Proofs*\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic constructs that enable a prover, denoted as P, to demonstrate to a verifier, indicated as V, that they possess knowledge of a secret value w, without disclosing any information about w. In ZKP literature, computations are frequently described using a circuit C, conceptually viewed as a function processing public and private inputs to produce a public output. Formally, P constructs a proof \u03c0 affirming their knowledge of a secret w such that C(x; w) = y, with x and y being the public inputs and outputs.\n\nPrior to generating a proof in ZKP frameworks, the circuit C undergoes *arithmetization*, transforming the computation using efficient mathematical constructs like polynomials. Although many ZKP schemes exist, such as zk-SNARKs [17], zk-STARKs [9], and MPCitH [18], all require some form of arithmetization for an efficient arithmetic representation of C. The intermediate representations when arithmetizing C (e.g. R1CS constraints in zk-SNARKS [19]), typically indicate the complexity of C, directly impacting the proof generation runtime of P. This metric is generally referred to as *constraints*.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [9] E. Ben-Sasson, I. Bentov, Y. Horesh, and M.

These may be useful for sensitive decisions like a merger or acquisition deal that the DAO does not want to make public.\n- Private membership allows DAOs to operate like traditional private member organizations. This is useful for a variety of use-cases, for example in sensitive security situations or for blinded peer review in scientific research.\n- Private treasuries enable DAOs to hide the contents of their treasuries as well as payments to and from those treasuries. Providing for privacy around payments allows for a return to the norms that many businesses and organizations expect. For example, many traditional companies shy away from using DAO tooling as they do not want to allow competitors to see their finances or their employees to see their compensation with respect to their peers.\n- Zero-knowledge compliance allows for DAOs to prove things about themselves without revealing confidential information. For example, proving that no members or payments received are on an OFAC registry or proving the amount of taxable DAO income for a DAO registered as an LLC.\n\nMore granular privacy primitives could be especially helpful in squaring the circle between the anonymity germane to public peer-to-peer networks and the disclosure requirements of governments and regulators.\n\n### 2.2 Private execution\n\nSummary: Privacy concerns extend beyond DAO management into the realm of DAO execution, where the actions of the DAO itself (usually through smartcontract execution) are public by default. This could be disadvantageous to some organizations. While some tools for private execution of operations exist, more work in computer science is needed to bridge between the status quo of public DAO execution and the ability of organizations to selectively act discretely for strategic reasons.\n\nBeyond the scope of integrating privacy primitives into various aspects of DAO management (treasuries, voting, membership), there is a broader issue concerning the privacy of DAO execution. Most existing traditional organizations rely on the privacy of their internal operations to function effectively. Broad operational privacy is crucial for defending against corporate espionage, protecting the confidentiality of individuals and communities served by the organization, enabling surprise product releases, and defending against other vulnerabilities\u2014issues that have been witnessed in DAOs as they have become more sophisticated [208].\n\nTo fully realize their potential, DAOs must offer greater choice in execution privacy while retaining their 'autonomous' character.\n\nIn general, this relies upon executing smart contracts privately, of which there has been extensive work. In particular, private contract execution via new chains has spawned both academic work (including theoretical analysis in [163] and in-production public chains. These approaches draw on a wide variety of technology primitives for privacy including secure multi-party computation (e.g., Enigma by Zyskind et al. [320], Eagle by Baum et al. [24], hardware enclaves [73, 158, 304], and zero-knowledge SNARKS (e.g., Hawk by Kosba et al. [169], [62], Bulletproofs by [52], zkay by [274], Zexe by [42], or via other schemes such as including UTXO-based systems [42, 292] and incentivized agreement of off-chain smart contract execution (e.g. Arbitrum, [157], if all parties are honest). Other approaches using permissioned blockchains to add privacy to smart contract execution [21, 46].\n\nMany of these systems operate via a fully private on-chain environment, especially those with the strongest privacy guarantees, and necessitate a shift in DAO operations onto a secure chain. Some approaches piggyback and interoperate with existing popular chains, however these privacy solutions are incomplete. For example, zkay and Zether go some way towards addressing this interoperability challenge with Ethereum, but their privacy guarantees are limited to payments (Zether) or specific private values (zkay). At the very least, most interoperable solutions with public chains always leak activity metadata on what contracts are executing.\n\nHybrid models, which exchange metadata been private and public execution at a minimum, are possible but need to be integrated with existing DAO tooling and undergo more battle testing and security analysis.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [21] A.

As the underlying legal ontologies and regulations evolve, agents would update their compliance parameters, ensuring that even emergent or newly discovered regulatory conflicts lead to prompt and reliable transaction rejections. This approach ensures that the ATCP/IP framework not only promotes trustless and autonomous IP exchanges, but also respects the pluralistic and ever-shifting tapestry of global legal standards.\n\nIn addition to evaluating jurisdictional compatibility, the compliance layer can incorporate reputation checks (see area of future research above titled \"Trust, Reputation, and Agent Discovery\"), based on an agent's historical behavior and adherence to both legal and ethical norms. When agents attempt to transact across different legal systems, the module can also query reputation scores, ensuring that only reputable, dispute-free agents proceed with cross-jurisdiction transactions. By considering both geographical legal compatibility and the track record of trustworthiness, this combined approach encourages the formation of stable, compliant, and credible cross-border IP agreements.\n\nAgent-to-Agent Negotiation Optimization To avoid simple transactions getting bogged down in minor detail differences between desired and offered license terms, optimizations could be explored. For example, a \"simple negotiation arbiter\" module[15], and each agent could adhere to specific \"risk tiers\" so that users could describe at what level of risk that a pair of conflicting offer/sale terms entail, they could give that module automatic permission to handle or not (e.g. maximum price or royalty rate difference amount, etc.). The \"risk tiers\" could have some preset risk declarations (akin to the preset Story licenses for Non-Commercial, Commercial Remix, etc.) to define the conditions for an automated escalation or shunt to human legal counsel to occur.\n\nOn the topic of negotiation optimization, another interesting area of research could be creating a more specialized AI Agent Dialogue Execution VM Architecture with a hybrid system design for efficient off-chain communication during negotiations while recording key results on-chain, ensuring both negotiation efficiency and transaction credibility/traceability.\n\nIP-based Digital Identity System As agents evolve into self-sufficient economic actors, developing robust IP-based digital identities becomes crucial for ensuring trust, reputation, and accountability across the network. Such a system could encompass multiple foundational elements. First, a standardized form of agent identity would provide unique, verifiable, and persistent identifiers, enabling counterparties to distinguish reputable agents from unknown entities. Next, an IP asset credit scoring system could dynamically gauge the value and trustworthiness of an agent's IP, factoring in historical transactions, licensing compliance, and dispute resolution outcomes. Finally, IP asset inventory management mechanisms would allow agents to efficiently track their holdings, verify provenance, and facilitate on-demand trading.\n\nConfidentiality and Zero-Knowledge Negotiation: As more sensitive or proprietary IP is traded among agents, ensuring confidentiality during the negotiation and licensing process becomes essential. Future research could explore the integration of zero-knowledge (ZK) and commit/reveal schemes, such as those offered by protocols like Lit Protocol[16], to enable terms negotiation without revealing the full content of each party's proposals. By using cryptographic commitments and ZK proofs, agents could verify key terms\u2014like pricing, usage restrictions, or compliance credentials\u2014without exposing underlying sensitive details. This allows the negotiation process to remain trustless, auditable, and secure, while simultaneously preserving the privacy and competitive advantage of each agent's intellectual property assets.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [15] R.

This means that in a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, the blockchain is accessible to everyone and every transaction can be traced back to the initial genesis block, allowing the connection of a person's several appearances and revealing their identity. Additionally, applications that rely on smart contracts, like e-government systems, may collect, store, and handle a significant amount of confidential data about citizen, clients, employees, products, and research. Users' trust and confidence are typically lost when such information is compromised. Cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection are problems with the present online e-government services due to the lack of proper authentication mechanism applied to input data from user and denial of service attacks (DOA) according to the reports in [25] [26]. Some countries replaced the old systems by blockchain technology; however, the complete view of privacy-preserving is not completely clear. Privacy can be enhanced with respect to identity perspective and data perspective.\n\n## **3.2.1 Identity Protection**\n\nMixer [27] scrambles multiple flows of transactions. The sender first sends the currency to the mixing provider, who mixes it with other transfers received within a predetermined period. The new scrambled record of transactions is then forwarded to the destination addresses. As a result, the link between the original transactor and their counterpart is broken.\n\n**Zerocoin:** uses Zero-knowledge proof to allow a fully anonymous currency transaction. The coins are minted first and later redeemed with a totally new one that has no history. The participant exchanges their base coin for a zerocoin that has no transaction history at all. It functions as a kind of coin laundry. Minting is the term for this altering process. The participant combines a secret random number r with a coin serial S that will be made public. Combine them and introduce the H(S,r) as a brand-new representation of their currency in the network. By demonstrating that he is aware of r and that h(r,s) corresponds to one of the mints in the blockchain, the participant uses non-interactive ZKP to authenticate coins to prove that they are his coins. The rule\n\nof miners here is to ensure that this serial number S hasn't been spent before as in figure 11 [28].\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_5_Figure_10.jpeg</img>\nFig. 11 A typical bitcoin transaction history is shown in chain a, where each transaction is connected to a previous transaction. Chain b shows a chain of zero coins. The linkage between mint and spend cannot be inferred from the block chain data.\n</F>\n\n**Ring Signature:** [29][30] allows a user (Member of a set) to sign a message on behalf of the \"ring\" of members but no way to tell who is the one that signed. In order to form a signature on behalf of the group, the signer must input the public keys of all the ring participants (including his own) to the algorithm input and use his own private key as a secret. *PK*0*, PK1....PKn*\n\nThe message has been signed by one of the sets, but the particular signer is unknown to the verifier in this case. The verifier can identify which member of the ring calculated the signature with a probability of 1 / n. Figure 12[31] illustrate the process of signature calculation.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_5_Figure_14.jpeg</img>\nFig. 12 Signature calculation process\n</F>\n\n## **3.2.2 Data Protection**\n\nIn [32] from the data perspective they proposed a blockchain model called Hawk that does not store the transactions clearly on the blockchain. Developers can separate smart contracts into the private and public portions using the Hawk concept. Codes relating to private information and financial operations may be written in the private portion, whereas codes unrelated to private information may be written in the public portion. Hawk compiles into three parts. (1). the code that, like smart contracts in Ethereum, will run on each virtual machine on each node. (2). the software that can only be run by smart contract users. (3). The manager, a specific trustworthy person in Hawk, will run the program. The manager has access to the contract's private information but will keep it confidential. If the manager terminates Hawk's protocol, it will be automatically financially penalized, and the users will gain compensation.\n\n# **3.3 Scalability**\n\nUsing blockchain technology in the government services will lead to having a large amount of data stored in the chain whereas the services have to be introduced instantly. There are two problems regarding scalability, throughput, and capacity. The first is generated from the waiting time for any transactions to be mined and included in a block because the block size is limited. Besides, if the block generation time is short, many forks will be generated, so the block generation time cannot be artificially reduced. On the other hand, if all the data are stored in a chain, the size of the chain becomes too large. Current blockchain size of Bitcoin and Ethereum are 163.34GB and 667.10GB consequently. Till 2020 there are several ways to solve these issues [33].\nSource 8:\n# if-ZKP: Intel FPGA-Based Acceleration of Zero Knowledge Proofs\n\nShahzad Ahmad Butt\u2217\u2020 , Benjamin Reynolds\u2217 , Veeraraghavan Ramamurthy\u2217 ,\n\nXiao Xiao\u2217 , Pohrong Chu\u2217 , Setareh Sharifian\u2217 , Sergey Gribok\u2217 , Bogdan Pasca\u2217\n\n\u2217 Intel Corporation\n\n101 Innovation Dr, San Jose, USA\n\nEmail: {first.lastname}@intel.com*\n\n\u2020Shahzad Ahmad Butt's email is shahzad.ahmad.butt@intel.com.\n\n*Abstract*\u2014Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as an important cryptographic technique allowing one party (prover) to prove the correctness of a statement to some other party (verifier) and nothing else. ZKPs give rise to user's privacy in many applications such as blockchains, digital voting, and machine learning. Traditionally, ZKPs suffered from poor scalability but recently, a sub-class of ZKPs known as Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledges (zk-SNARKs) have addressed this challenge. They are getting significant attention and are being implemented by many public libraries. In this paper, we present a novel scalable architecture that is suitable for accelerating the zk-SNARK prover compute on FPGAs. We focus on the multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) that accounts for the majority of computation time spent in zk-SNARK systems. The MSM calculations extensive rely on modular arithmetic so highly optimized Intel IP Libraries for modular arithmetic are used. The proposed architecture exploits the parallelism inherent to MSM and is implemented using the Intel OneAPI framework for FPGAs. Our implementation runs 110x-150x faster compared to reference software library, uses a generic curve form in Jacobian coordinates and is the first to report FPGA hardware acceleration results for BLS12-381 and BN128 family of elliptic curves.\n\n### I. INTRODUCTION\n\nAs our dependence on online activities continues to increase, the presence of the Internet brings forth potential risks. Our vulnerability to scams, identity theft, intrusive advertisers, governmental control, and unidentified sources of danger also grows simultaneously. Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) serve as a remedy for these privacy risks by granting users the ability to regulate the gathering, dissemination, and utilization of personal information and daily actions. These sophisticated PETs employ intricate cryptographic methods to offer privacyfocused alternatives to technologies that neglect the importance of safeguarding personal privacy.\n\nThere are many PETs which may considered as part of data protection compliance including Homomorphic encryption (HE), Secure multiparty computation (SMPC), Trusted execution environments (TEE) and Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). In this paper we focus on ZKP due to it's growing prominence in blockchain projects such as Ethereum, Filecoin and Zcash. Fundamentally, ZKPs enable a *prover* to assure a *verifier(s)* of the truthfulness of a statement without divulging any confidential information and do so in a secure fashion. This dynamic allows a *verifier* to authenticate information while simultaneously enabling the *prover* to maintain the confidentiality of their secret data. The potential of this relationship for enhancing security systems across various applications is significant provided they can be feasibly implemented in real-world scenarios. This recent increase in attention is due to the advancement of a ZKP type known as a zk-SNARK. More precisely, zk-SNARK constructions such as Groth16 [1] and PlonK [2] have enabled significant progress in our ability to develop functional zk-SNARKs capable of deployment in production level systems.\n\nA closer examination of these zk-SNARK systems reveals that although the proofs outputs are small for quick verification, the proof generation process itself is notably computationally intensive. This is because to uphold stringent security standards in these schemes, these systems consist of tens or hundreds of millions of constraints and utilize technology such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) which requires many large bitwidth mathematical operations. For example, in applications such as Filecoin, the proof circuits used in their SNARKs encompass up to 2 27 constraints [3] and operate on 381-bitwidth numbers. This level of complexity underscores the immense compute requirement for secure and reliable proof generation in these systems.\n\nFor this reason, both industry and academia have started to develop solutions to offload this compute to accelerators, aiming to enhance the practicality of ZKP schemes being deployed in real world applications. While GPUs, due to their robust software ecosystem and established presence in the blockchain industry, are often the primary target for acceleration solutions in this domain, we believe that FPGAs provide the flexibility and capability for hardware fine-tuning which is essential to building an efficient solution in the rapidly evolving blockchain industry.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] J.

It is announced at the annual RSA Conference in recognition of innovations and contributions in the field of cryptography. An award committee of experts, which is associated with the Cryptographer's Track committee at the RSA Conference (CT-RSA),  nominates to the award persons who are pioneers in their field, and whose work has had applied or theoretical lasting value; the award is typically given for the lifetime achievements throughout the nominee's entire career.   Nominees are often affiliated with universities or involved with research and development in the information technology industry. The award is cosponsored by the International Association for Cryptologic Research.\n\nWhile the field of modern cryptography started to be an active research area in the 1970s, it has already contributed heavily to Information technology and has served as a critical component in advancing the world of computing: the Internet, Cellular networks, and Cloud computing, Information privacy, Privacy engineering, Anonymity, Storage security, and Information security, to mention just a few sectors and areas. Research in Cryptography as a scientific field involves the disciplines of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Engineering. The award, which started in 1998, is one of the few recognitions fully dedicated to acknowledging experts who have advanced the field of cryptography and its related areas (another such recognition is achieving the rank of an IACR Fellow).\n\nThe first recipient of the award in 1998 was Shafi Goldwasser. Also, many of the award winners have gotten other recognitions, such as other prestigious awards, and the rank of fellow in various professional societies, etc.\n\nResearch in Cryptography is broad and is dedicated to numerous areas. In fact, the award has, over the years, emphasized the methodological contributions to the field which involve mathematical research in various ways, and has recognized achievements in many of the following crucial areas of research: \n Some areas are in the general Computational number theory and Computational algebra fields, or in the fields of Information theory and Computational complexity theory, where proper mathematical structures are constructed or investigated as underlying mathematics to be employed in the field of cryptography; \n Some areas are  theoretical in nature, where new notions for Cryptographic primitives are defined and their security is carefully formalized as foundations of the field, some work is influenced by Quantum computing as well; \n Some areas are dedicated to designing new or improved primitives from concrete or abstract mathematical mechanisms for Symmetric-key cryptography, Public-key cryptography, and Cryptographic protocols (such as Zero-knowledge proofs, Secure multi-party computations, or Threshold cryptosystems); \n Some other areas are dedicated to Cryptanalysis: the breaking of cryptographic systems and mechanisms; \n Yet some other areas are dedicated to the actual practice of cryptography and its efficient cryptographic hardware and software implementations, to developing and deploying new actual protocols (such as the Transport Layer Security and IPsec) to be used by information technology applications and systems. Also included are research areas where principles and basic methods are developed for achieving security and privacy in computing and communication systems.\n\nTo further read on various aspects of cryptography, from history to areas of modern research, see Books on cryptography.\n\nIt is worth noting that in addition to the Award for Excellence in Mathematics which recognizes lifetime achievement in the specific area of Cryptographic research, the RSA conference has also presented a separate lifetime achievement awards in the more general field of information security.

Computation in the ZK domain is often expressed as a circuit C, which can informally be thought of as a function that takes in public and private inputs, and generates a public output. Formally, P generates a proof attesting that they know a secret value such that(;) = , in which and are public inputs and outputs, respectively. Note that such a proof does not reveal anything about the witness to anybody, including the verifier V. Before a proof can be generated in ZKP schemes, the circuit C must go through a process called arithmetization, in which the computation is represented in efficient mathematical terms (e.g. polynomials). For brevity's sake, we treat arithmetization as a black-box, in which C is converted into a ZKP scheme-specific mathematical representation. Below, we briefly outline zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, two of the seminal ZKP constructions.\n\nZero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) are a class of non-interactive ZKP protocols that guarantee succinct proof size. The most commonly used proving scheme in zk-SNARK constructions is the Groth16 protocol [29], which generates publicly-verifiable proofs, around 128 bytes. The underlying cryptography for Groth16 is computationally intensive elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) [15]. The main hindrance of using Groth16 zk-SNARKs in practical settings is its reliance on a computationally heavy trusted setup process per circuit C, which is necessary to generate protocol keys for P and V to assist with proof generation and verification. This, however, is often acceptable in practice in scenarios where C is not changing.\n\nZero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKs) are a class of ZKP protocols that remove the dependence on the trusted setup process. Rather than using ECC, zk-STARKs utilize lightweight, post-quantum safe cryptography for proof generation, relying on collision-resistant hash functions. These hash functions lend themselves nicely to proof generation, as the main underlying data structure is the Merkle tree, which often results in non-succinct proofs [14]. Although not as efficient as zk-SNARK verification, zk-STARK verification is kept somewhat efficient by only verifying certain critical paths of the Merkle tree, which are described in the generated proof, instead of the whole Merkle tree.\n\n#### 2.2 ZK-Friendly Hash Functions\n\nOne general metric that is used to measure the size of ZK arithmetic representations is the number of constraints. In brief, constraints are an intermediate form of representation of the circuit C that helps form the final mathematical statement, but these constraints generally indicate how complex a circuit is in the ZK domain. The goal of ZK-friendly hashes is to perform cryptographically secure collision-resistant hashing, while only requiring a minimal amount of constraints. Hash functions are very often used in zk-SNARK and zk-STARK prover and verifier algorithms for hash chaining, Merkle trees, commitments, and integrity checks with proofs of hash preimages. Our work focuses on hardware acceleration of\n\n<sup>1</sup>https://github.com/ACES-STAM/AMAZE\n\nMiMC, a ZK-friendly hash function which is optimized to minimize the amount of constraints in zk-SNARKs, but has proven to be effective in zk-STARKs too [16]. There has been a notable increase in research that presents new ZK-friendly hash functions, such as Vision/Rescue [10], GMiMC [9], and Poseidon [27]. While each hash function aims to optimize for different parameters, the overarching goal of each work is to produce a low-overhead approach for secure hashing in the ZK domain. We prioritize MiMC in this work due to its prominence in current ZKP-based systems [22, 31], but note that the underlying modules that we present in AMAZE can be utilized to accelerate other notable ZK-friendly hash functions as well, especially those that rely on Galois field arithmetic.\n\n#### 2.3 Galois Field Arithmetic\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [9] Martin R Albrecht, Lorenzo Grassi, L\u00e9o Perrin, Sebastian Ramacher, Christian Rechberger, Dragos Rotaru, Arnab Roy, and Markus Schofnegger. 2019.

    "without_rag": {
      "response_tokens": 1335,
      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to design a liquidation protection mechanism for overcollateralized lending protocols (OCLPs) that can handle extreme market volatility. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, what exactly is an OLP? From what I remember, an OLP is when people borrow money to pay off their loans with each other in exchange for some kind of security or collateral. But if the market goes really bad and the collateral runs out, that's where liquidation protection comes in, right?\n\nThe challenge here is to make sure these protocols are protected during extreme events because they can't handle sudden drops in liquidity. So, I think the first thing I need to do is understand how OCLPs typically work. Usually, they require users to provide collateral when borrowing. But if that doesn't happen, the lender has to liquidate the loan, meaning pay back the money, which would result in a loss for everyone involved.\n\nNow, extreme volatility is going to push this even higher. The market might crash, and without enough collateral or some sort of fallback mechanism, the OLP's investors could lose all their capital. So, I need something that can handle that situation more gracefully.\n\nLet me think about existing mechanisms. One idea is setting a minimum amount of collateral each user has to provide. But if someone goes into debt with less than that, they should still be able to liquidate. Maybe a lower threshold? That could make the protocols more resilient during times of uncertainty.\n\nAnother thought is dynamic thresholds. Like, if the market drops too much, some users might trigger an alert and automatically increase their collateral contributions. But how would that work without complicating the system too much?\n\nAlso, there's the idea of having multiple liquidation channels or fallback mechanisms. Maybe different protocols in the network can handle part of the debt during a crash. Or perhaps some sort of insurance mechanism where the OLP agrees to keep some reserves and let others take over if needed.\n\nI wonder about the financial instruments they might use for liquidation. Maybe derivatives like futures or options could be used to lock in price changes, ensuring that the OLP can protect its position even during volatile times.\n\nWait, but what about the risks of default? If one user fails to contribute enough collateral, it shouldn't immediately cause a significant loss. Perhaps the mechanism should have a cap on the maximum amount that needs to be liquidated, or some form of insurance coverage for defaults.\n\nAlso, scalability comes into play. The liquidation process can't be too slow or complicated so as to disrupt normal operations. Maybe having a centralized system where defaulters are automatically credited with their debt in a timely manner without delaying overall transactions.\n\nI should also consider how this mechanism interacts with other features of OCLPs, like auto-liquidations and the role of intermediaries. The liquidation protection needs to complement these features rather than replace them, so that both can work together during extreme events.\n\nAnother angle is the role of smart contracts in managing liquidity. They could automate certain parts of the process, making it easier to handle large volumes of transactions and protect against errors.\n\nI'm also thinking about how this mechanism would be integrated into existing protocols. Maybe starting with a basic model that only requires users to contribute some minimal collateral, then building up more sophisticated features as needed for robust protection during extreme market conditions.\n\nIt's important to consider the regulatory environment here too. OLPs need to comply with certain financial regulations related to liquidation mechanisms, so they might require specific safeguards or compliance with existing rules to avoid legal issues.\n\nLastly, monitoring and alerting come into play. The mechanism needs to have real-time data to detect when market conditions are volatile enough that a liquidation is necessary. It should trigger alerts quickly so that the OLP can respond appropriately without causing operational stress.\n\nSo, putting this all together, I think the proposed liquidation protection mechanism would involve:\n\n1. Setting minimal collateral requirements for each user.\n2. Implementing dynamic thresholds where users automatically increase their contributions when market conditions deteriorate.\n3. Using derivative instruments to lock in price changes during liquidations.\n4. Creating fallback mechanisms with other OCLPs or intermediaries to handle debt if individual protocols fail to liquidate.\n5. Implementing a robust default management system that limits the immediate impact of defaults and provides insurance coverage.\n6. Utilizing smart contracts for automated liquidity processes and real-time data analysis for monitoring market conditions.\n7. Ensuring compliance with financial regulations related to OCLPs to avoid legal issues.\n\nThis approach should provide a more resilient liquidation process during extreme times, allowing OCLPs to remain operational and secure even when there's significant market uncertainty.\n</think>\n\nTo design a robust liquidation protection mechanism for overcollateralized lending protocols (OCLPs) that can handle extreme market volatility, consider the following structured approach:\n\n### 1. **Minimal Collateral Requirements**\n   - Introduce a lower threshold for collateral contribution from each user. This ensures that even during volatile periods, OCLPs remain secure.\n\n### 2. **Dynamic Thresholds with Alerts**\n   - Implement dynamic thresholds where users automatically increase their contributions when market conditions deteriorate. This reduces the risk of immediate liquidation due to insufficient collateral.\n\n### 3. **Derivative Instruments for Pricing**\n   - Use financial derivatives like futures or options to lock in price changes, preventing sudden losses during liquidity disputes.\n\n### 4. **Fallback Mechanisms**\n   - Create fallback mechanisms with other OCLPs or intermediaries. This allows debt to be handled through different protocols when one fails to liquidate.\n\n### 5. **Default Management and Insurance**\n   - Develop a default management system that limits the impact of defaults. Include insurance coverage for limited potential losses, ensuring minimal financial strain.\n\n### 6. **Smart Contracts for Automation**\n   - Utilize smart contracts to automate liquidity processes, facilitating efficient transactions and reducing human intervention during volatile times.\n\n### 7. **Real-Time Data Monitoring**\n   - Implement real-time data analysis to detect volatile market conditions promptly. This enables quick response mechanisms during liquidations.\n\n### 8. **Compliance with Regulations**\n   - Ensure adherence to financial regulations related to OCLPs, avoiding legal issues that could arise from inadequate protection measures.\n\n### 9. **Operational Adjustments**\n   - Integrate these features into existing protocols, starting with basic models and expanding as needed for robust protection during extreme events.\n\nThis approach provides a resilient liquidation mechanism that enhances OCLP operations and security in volatile markets."

      "response_tokens": 1147,
      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to understand this problem about lending pools and their parameters. From what I gather, lending pools are like collections of money deposited with different institutions, and they have specific rules for borrowing that money from other lenders. But it seems complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nThe text talks about utilization functions being a big issue. They say these functions aren't theoretically justified because the way lenders increase interest as more loans are made is piecewise linear, which can be inefficient and lead to problems like large profits if users withdraw a lot. Also, they're not good at modeling different risk or interest rates for different borrowers.\n\nThen it mentions barrier options. I remember from finance that an option gives the holder the right to buy or sell an asset at a certain price before expiration. A barrier option is similar but only becomes valid if the underlying asset crosses a certain threshold. So, in this context, lending pool loans could be modeled like barrier options where the loan amount increases when a certain condition (like liquidation) is met.\n\nThe text then says that replicating DeFi lending with options can lead to impossibility results because standard option pricing models might not handle all the complexities of lending pools. They mention time-varying interest rates and fixed fees, which complicate things even more.\n\nThey introduce a model where lenders charge a fixed fee plus variable interest on borrowed funds if liquidation occurs when it should not. Through simulations, they find that in this setup, there's no possible fair bundle of parameters that can stabilize the lending pool system. That seems like a key finding because it shows that without proper models or mechanisms, lending pools can be unstable.\n\nI'm still a bit fuzzy on how exactly barrier options are used here. Maybe each loan is an option where if certain conditions are met (like liquidation), the lender can take a step-by-step interest increase instead of a single one? That would make sense because it's similar to how interest rates usually escalate over time in most financial products.\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the fixed fee part. Why would lenders charge a flat fee plus variable interest? Perhaps this is intended to control the exposure or reduce systemic risk by ensuring some base interest regardless of conditions, which could help prevent large profits from users withdrawing without affecting the system much.\n\nThe impossibility result suggests that it's hard to balance multiple factors like different risk levels and varying interest rates in a lending pool system. Without a solid theoretical framework, the market might be too unstable. So, this research is important because it highlights the need for better models or mechanisms to handle such complexities.\n\nI wonder how the simulations work here. They must have tested various scenarios with different parameters\u2014like liquidation thresholds, user withdrawal rates, interest rate dynamics over time\u2014to see if any combination leads to a stable system. The conclusion that no fair bundle exists implies that such combinations can't stabilize the system under realistic conditions, which is a big deal for financial systems.\n\nOverall, this paper seems to be pushing the boundaries of how we model complex financial products like lending pools by connecting them to option pricing theory. It's making a significant contribution by showing potential limitations in current models and suggesting areas where improvements are needed.\n</think>\n\nThe study examines the stability of lending pools through the lens of option pricing theory, revealing key insights into their modeling challenges:\n\n1. **Utilization Functions**: The piecewise linear nature of interest rate increases leads to inefficiencies and instability, as users can manipulate rates by withdrawing supplies.\n\n2. **Barrier Options**: By modeling lending pools like barrier options, the study suggests that loan amounts increase upon meeting certain conditions (liquidation), offering a new perspective on risk and exposure.\n\n3. **Impossibility Result**: Simulations using realistic models show no fair parameter combinations exist in typical scenarios, indicating potential market instability without robust mechanisms.\n\n4. **Fixed Fees and Time-Varying Rates**: Lenders charge fixed fees plus variable interest, aiming to control exposure but complicating stability analysis.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The research highlights the need for improved theoretical frameworks to manage complexities in lending pools, emphasizing the importance of better modeling to prevent instability.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe study demonstrates that modeling lending pools using option pricing principles leads to several challenges: inefficiencies with utilization functions, difficulties in handling varying risk and interest rates, and potential market instability.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized lending by replacing intermediaries with algorithm-driven liquidity pools. However, existing platforms like Aave and Compound rely on static interest rate curves and collateral requirements that struggle to adapt to rapid market changes, leading to inefficiencies in utilization and increased risks of liquidations. In this work, we propose a dynamic model of the lending market based on evolving demand and supply curves, alongside an adaptive interest rate controller that responds in real-time to shifting market conditions. Using a Recursive Least Squares algorithm, our controller estimates tracks the external market and achieves stable utilization, while also minimizing risk. We provide theoretical guarantees on the interest rate convergence and utilization stability of our algorithm. We establish bounds on the system's vulnerability to adversarial manipulation compared to static curves, while quantifying the trade-off between adaptivity and adversarial robustness. Our dynamic curve demand/supply model demonstrates a low best-fit error on Aave data, while our interest rate controller significantly outperforms static curve protocols in maintaining optimal utilization and minimizing liquidations.\n\nKeywords: Lending \u00b7 Decentralized Finance \u00b7 Recursive Least Squares \u00b7 Adversarial Robustness\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nLending markets in DeFi Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has transformed lending by removing centralized intermediaries like banks, replacing them with transparent, algorithmdriven liquidity pools. Platforms such as Aave [3] and Compound [6] enable lenders to provide capital that borrowers access by pledging collateral. A key goal of these protocols is to maintain stable utilization rates, adjusting interest rates to balance supply and demand [ 9]. Low utilization results in lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, while rising utilization drives up rates to manage liquidity. Another critical parameter is the collateral factor, which ensures borrower risk is minimized while keeping markets attractive. Setting appropriate collateral levels requires assessing recent price behavior of the collateral asset and the lender's risk tolerance [12].\n\nCurrent approaches Current DeFi platforms determine interest rates based on a static function of utilization [ 7 , 8]. This approach uses utilization to represent supply/demand\n\ndynamics, market risk, and attractiveness, relying on a manually set, arbitrary interest rate curve. Additionally, collateral factors in these markets are established through a thorough process involving community proposals and reviews [2, 5], which are voted on every few months or so.\n\nChallenges in adapting to market conditions Current DeFi systems are slow to adapt to rapid market changes, leading to potential losses and increased risks due to delayed parameter adjustments, particularly during major price fluctuations. For instance, between August 1 and August 6, 2024, Aave ETH V3 experienced over $116M in liquidations due to a significant price drop in ETH. Among the affected users, only 45% ($53M) actively increased their collateral just before being liquidated. It turns out that a 15% increase in the over-collateralization ratio could have nearly halved the number of liquidations for these users (see Figure 1b). However, Aave's slow response in adjusting collateral ratios and liquidation thresholds failed to avert these outcomes. Additionally, Aave has faced challenges in maintaining optimal utilization levels during rapid, unforeseen market changes, particularly when demand spikes due to new yield farming opportunities or similar events (see Figure 1a).\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_3.jpeg</img>\n</F>\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_4.jpeg</img>\n</F>\n\n(a) Lending platforms fail to adapt to market demand and supply changes\n\n(b) A slight increase in the collateral ratio could have reduced liquidations\n\nModeling markets and adaptive lending pools The first challenge in designing a better lending protocols is to model the existing population of DeFi lenders and borrowers. We start this work by proposing a model based on changing demand and supply curves with noise (Section 2). We define an optimal interest rate controller to be the one that sets the rate exactly equal to the equilibrium rate that realizes the desired utilization given the current market conditions. Our goal is to design an optimally adaptive lending protocol for this model, and to quantify the agility with which the protocol can change based on external market conditions.\n\nAdaptivity versus Robustness Introducing adaptivity into a protocol can increase its vulnerability to manipulation [10], as an adaptive protocol adjusts based on recent market activities, learning from the trades made by borrowers and lenders. However, an adversary can exploit this by distorting the historical trade data, making the protocol respond to false shifts in demand or supply. Therefore, it is crucial to quantify the tradeoff between adaptivity and adversarial robustness before deploying any new lending protocol. Specifically, we assess how much the interest rate can be manipulated when an adversary controls a portion of the total demand and supply.\n\nThe following sections summarize our results and set the broader research context in which we make these contributions.\n\n### 1.1 Our Contributions\n\nDynamic model and evaluation metrics:(Section 2) We propose a dynamic model of the lending market via evolving demand and supply curves for the lent asset. We introduce three core metrics to evaluate DeFi lending platforms, focusing on targeting a specific utilization, liquidation/default risk, and the robustness of the protocol to adversarial manipulations.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [2] Aave finance governance. https://app.aave.com/governance/, accessed: 2023-05\n- [3] Aave whitepaper. https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol/ blob/master/docs/Aave_Protocol_Whitepaper_v1_0.pdf, accessed: 2024-02\n- [5] Compound finance governance. https://compound.finance/ governance, accessed: 2023-05\n- [6] Compound whitepaper. https://compound.finance/documents/ Compound.Whitepaper.pdf, accessed: 2024-02\n- [10] Making sense of the defi lending meta. https://www.gauntlet.xyz/ resources/making-sense-of-the-defi-lending-meta, accessed: 2024-02\n- [12] Navigating risks in defi lending. https://medium.com/intotheblock/ navigating-risks-in-defi-lending-a034dbf83b54, accessed: 2023-05\n#endreference\nSource 3:\n# Assessing Stablecoin Credit Risks\n\nYuval Boneh1 and Ethan Jones2\n\n1Conclave Head of Defi, yuvi@conclave.io 2Conclave CEO, bebis@conclave.io\n\n#### Abstract\n\nThis paper delves into the spectrum of credit risks associated with decentralized stablecoin issuance, ranging from overcollateralized lending to business-to-business credit. It examines the mechanisms, risks, and mitigation strategies at each layer, highlighting the potential for scaling decentralized stablecoins while ensuring systemic health.\n\nKeywords: Decentralized Finance, Cryptocurrency, Stablecoin, Credit, Risk\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nCredit risks in decentralized stablecoin issuance exist on a spectrum, with each layer introducing unique outcomes and requiring tailored mitigation strategies (Figure 1). Understanding these risks is crucial for the sustainable growth of decentralized stablecoins. This paper explores the spectrum from overcollateralized lending to business-to-business credit, detailing the mechanisms, risks, and mitigation strategies involved.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_2.jpeg</img>\nFigure 1: Representation of decentralized stablecoin credit risk spectrum.\n</F>\n\nRisks are quantified using discretized nomenclature describing the Likelihood and Consequenece of undesirable outcomes. Each descriptor is discretized into three tiers to present a simple approach, however sophisticated risk managers and underwriters may choose to discretize further in order to better quantify the effects of mitigations. The nomenclature employed in this paper is defined in Table 1.\n\n<T>\n| Table 1: Risk level definitions |\n| --- |\n| Descriptor | Level | Definition |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Low (A) | Not expected to occur. |\n| Likelihood | Medium (B) | May foreseeably occur. |\n|  | High (C) | Certain to occur. |\n|  | Low (1) | Marginal, temporary impact to systemic health. |\n| Consequence | Medium (2) | Considerable, temporary impact to systemic health. |\n|  | High (3) | Existential impact to systemic health. |\n</T>\n\nA summary of the risks identified in this paper can be located in Appendix A, and should be viewed in conjunction with the paper itself.\n\n### 1.1 Scope\n\nFor most types of issuance expressed in this paper there exists a certain level of trust in the mechanisms that govern risk and return when a new line of credit is underwritten. In the simplest example, Uniswap V2, the AMM function of the platform will always abide by the invariant x*y=k. On Aave, supply and demand is managed by Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratios and interest rate mechanisms.\n\nIn underwriting lines of credit to functions or systems, security and risk transfer must be handled entirely by these algorithms. In certain cases, extreme capital efficiency can be achieved by using these algorithms to define and govern risk relationships between counterparties.\n\nThis paper explores risks introduced specifically by the credit functions described and does not delve into extant risks beyond the scope of stablecoin credit issuance. Certain dependency risks, such as security exploits, are not unique to credit issuance and are considered out-of-scope for the purpose of this paper. Despite this, a thorough understanding of each mechanism, their potential edge-cases, and the means through which they can be modified or invalidated is required to properly underwrite defi loans.\n\n## 2. Overcollateralized Lending\n\nThe lowest risk level of credit issuance is overcollateralized lending (Figure 2), as seen in protocols that rely on collateralized debt positions. Stablecoins cannot be minted, in or out of circulation, unless they are collateralized by assets, autonomously underwriting the loan. The primary risk is that the value of the asset backing the loan depreciates to below the loan value, referred to as Liquidation Risk.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_2_Figure_6.jpeg</img>\nFigure 2: Overcollateralized Lending on the decentralized stablecoin credit risk spectrum.\n</F>\n\n### 2.1 Aave and GHO\n\nAave's GHO stablecoin uses overcollateralization principles to maintain a stable value. \"GHO is minted upon the supply of crypto-assets in excess of the value of GHO to be minted\" (Frangella & Valeri, 2022). The value of debt compared to collateral is referred to as the Health Factor, and accounts for the Liquidation Threshold. If a user deposits $10,000 worth of a collateral asset that has a Liquidation Threshold of 80%, the maximum amount of $GHO they would be able to borrow (ignoring Loan-To-Value Ratio limitations) is $8,000. At this point, their Health Factor would be 1, and if the value of their collateral dropped below $10,000, they would be at risk of liquidation. If liquidated, their collateral assets would be sold to recover the debt and part or all of the difference in value would be retained by the liquidator. This incentivizes liquidators to keep the protocol healthy, and disincentivizes borrowers from excessively leveraging their collateral.\n\nOvercollateralized lending typically transfers Liqudiation Risk to asset suppliers, who are compensated by receiving a majority of the interest paid by asset borrowers. In the case of $GHO, Aave maintains risk ownership by minting $GHO to the borrower instead of having users supply $GHO. In turn, Aave keeps the interest paid on $GHO borrowed.\n\nThe Aave DAO manually adjusts debt limits and interest rates to ensure the value of $GHO remains pegged to $1. If users borrow $GHO and sell it excessively and the price drops, the Aave DAO will vote to increase the interest rate, pressuring borrowers to buy back $GHO to repay their loans. The same occurs in the other direction, whereby the Aave DAO may vote to decrease rates in order to expand the supply of $GHO.\n\n### 2.2 Liquidation Risk\n\nLiquidation Risk is perceived to have High likelihood since leverage is the core purpose of such a product, and Medium consequence, since it is not necessarily an existential threat. This risk has been realized historically by CDPs and lending protocols and losses are often covered by the protocol. This risk is mitigated upfront with adequate interest rates, and further mitigated with robust liquidation and redistribution infrastructure, ensuring a margin of safety defined by the Loan-To-Value ratio, liquidation threshold, liquidation bonus, etc.\n\nThese mitigations reduce the Likelihood of the risk eventuating by compensating issuers for assuming risk (where applicable) and liquidators for liquidating unhealthy positions before bad debt is accrued and unbacked stablecoins can circulate.\nSource 4:\n# **4.2 Collateral factor planner**\n\nWe conducted an experiment to evaluate the performance of our collateral factor planner. The optimality index is defined as in Definition 6 with *\u03bb* = 0 and *U*opt = 0*.*5. Initially, the system starts with an unoptimized collateral factor of *c* = 0*.*95. At timeslot *t* = 200, the optimizer activates and sets a new collateral factor of *c* = 0*.*84, which adjusts the utilization to the desired level of 0*.*5 soon after that (the pace of reaching the equilibrium is a function of lenders' elasticity). At timeslot *t* = 3000, a change in price volatility disrupts the system. By timeslot *t* = 3200, the estimator accurately detects the new volatility and triggers the optimizer. The optimizer then sets a new collateral factor of *c* = 0*.*64, which stabilizes the utilization around 0*.*5 once again. This entire process is automated. The resulting utilization curve is shown in Figure 3.\n\n### **5 Conclusion and discussion**\n\n**Modelling deFi borrow-lending user behavior** In this paper, we present a first-principles model of the behavior and incentives of borrowers and lenders in a DeFi market. We consider their alternative strategies and analyze how to achieve market equilibrium in the presence of price volatility. We mention empirical evidence on the validity of our model.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_20_Figure_1.jpeg</img>\n</F>\n\nUtilization, Collateral Factor, and Price Volatility Over Time\n\n#### **Figure 3**\n\n**Two-level protocol design** We propose a data-driven, borrow-lending protocol that sets the interest rate and over-collateralization ratio adaptively. By monitoring user reactions and learning from their behavior, our protocol determines a competitive interest rates and optimal collateral factors. The protocol consists of two components, 1) Fast interest rate controller: This component reacts online to user behavior, ensuring competitive interest rates and preventing over- or underpaying users. It has theoretical guarantees for fast convergence to the equilibrium interest rate. 2) Slow collateral factor planner: This component uses accurate market condition estimates to adjust the collateral factor, maintaining utilization at a desired level while controlling default risk. Overall, our protocol ensures rapid convergence to the equilibrium interest rate and optimal tuning of the collateral factor to achieve a desired equilibrium.\n\n**Implementation** We implement our protocol and test its performance using simulated users, including uninformed ones. We compare our protocol with a baseline that uses piecewise linear functions to set interest rates based on utilization. Our protocol demonstrates superior performance compared to the baseline in practice.\n\n#### **References**\n\n- **1** Aave finance governance. https://app.aave.com/governance/.

Borrowers can repay their loans to reclaim their collateral unless their loan was liquidated, which happens when the value of the collateral dips significantly. Interest rates for these pools are currently set via supply and demand heuristics, which have several downsides, including inefficiency, inflexibility, and being vulnerable to manipulation. Here, we reduce lending pools to options, and then use ideas from options pricing to search for fair interest rates for lending pools. In a simplified model where the loans have a fixed duration and can only be repaid at the end of the term, we obtain analytical pricing results. We then consider a more realistic model, where loans can be repaid dynamically and without expiry. Our main theoretical contribution is to show that fair interest rates do not exist in this setting. We then show that impossibility results generalize even to models of lending pools which have no obvious reduction to options. To address these negative results, we introduce a model of lending pools with fixed fees, and model the ability of borrowers to top-up their loans to reduce the risk of liquidation. As a proof of concept, we use simulations to show how our model's predicted interest rates compare to interest rates in practice.\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> Joe Halpern and Aditya Saraf were supported in part by NSF grant FMitF-2319186, ARO grant W911NF-22-1-0061, MURI grant W911NF-19-1-0217, and a grant from the Cooperative AI Foundation.\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) involves the use of blockchain technology, including cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, to provide decentralized alternatives to traditional financial services like lending, currency exchanges, or derivatives trading. Lending pools are DeFi services where several users (the lenders) pool together their cryptocurrency to loan out, charging interest to borrowers. Traditional loans are often collateralized by non-liquid assets, such as a car, house or business. But DeFi lending pools are completely decentralized and anonymous, and so lending pools require borrowers to provide liquid collateral worth more than the loan they receive. This collateral is provided in a different cryptocurrency \u2013 typically, lenders will pool together a more stable currency, like USDC (USD Coin), and accept a more volatile currency, like ETH (Ethereum). Because lending pool loans are overcollateralized, they do not serve the typical purpose of traditional loans: increasing one's liquidity. Instead these lending pool loans can be used to increase the borrower's exposure to the cryptocurrency deposited as collateral.\n\nConsider the example of a lending pool that gives out loans of USDC and holds ETH as collateral. Suppose the current market rate is 1 ETH = 100 USDC and that the overcollateralization parameter, c, is 1.5; this means that depositing 1 ETH as collateral would yield a loan of 100/1.5 \u2248 67 USDC. The borrower can then purchase 0.67 ETH on the market. If ETH rises to 110 USDC, the borrower can sell their 0.67 ETH for 73.7 USDC on the market, and then repay their loan, spending 67 USDC to reclaim their 1 ETH. Their net worth in USDC would then be 110 + 73.7 \u2212 67 = 116.7, an increase of 16.7% from a 10% rise in the value of ETH, due to their increased exposure to ETH.\n\nLending pools loans also have a risk of liquidation. The health factor of a lending pool loan is the ratio of the value of the collateral to the value owed. This starts near the overcollateralization parameter when the loan is initialized, but could decrease if the collateral dips in value. If the health factor drops below a liquidation parameter, which we denote c0, then the loan is subject to liquidation: the borrower's collateral is sold to third parties at a discount. Typically, c0 > 1, so that even after a discount, the pool can recoup the value of the loan.\n\n# Fair Interest Rates Are Impossible for Lending Pools: Results from Options Pricing\n\nIn practice, lending pools are very popular. Platforms like Aave and Compound have over $10.6B USD of total value locked, which is over 1/8 of the total value locked in all DeFi protocols at the time of writing.1 But one\n\n<sup>1</sup> https://www.stelareum.io/en/defi-tvl/lending.html\n\nimportant feature of lending pools that was omitted in the previous example is that they charge interest rates to borrowers. So, in the example above, the borrower would have to pay slightly more than 67 USDC to reclaim their 1 ETH collateral. How should these interest rates be set? In practice, lending pools use supply and demand to set these interest rates. Lenders pool together currency, and increase the interest rate for borrowing that currency as more of it is utilized (i.e., lent out). This is typically done via piecewise linear functions: the interest rate slowly increases until an inflection point, after which the interest more rapidly increases. This approach, though simple, has many disadvantages.\n\nOne issue is that these utilization functions are not theoretically justified. This leads to several problems. First, without a proper theory, it's difficult to construct the \"best\" utilization function. Big lending pools sometimes offload this problem \u2013 for example, Compound currently pays $2 million a year to the risk management firm Gauntlet to help them set their interest rate.2 Second, even the \"best\" piecewise linear utilization functions are inefficient: Bastankhah et al. (2024) shows that such protocols converge very slowly in the presence of slower users, and never reach the true market equilibrium interest. Finally, it's difficult to tell whether or not the interest rates offered by the protocol are favorable as a potential borrower or lender. A better theoretical foundation will address these issues.\n\nThough the problems described above could be addressed by a better theory of utilization functions, utilization functions have other issues in general. First, large suppliers can manipulate the interest rates by withdrawing some of their supply. Doing so would cause the interest rates to increase, and if borrowers are slow to react, could lead to large profits for the suppliers. Yaish et al. (2023) formalizes this intuition, describes the optimal lending strategy, and shows that several large suppliers can increase their profits up to 700% by selectively withdrawing part of their supply. Second, utilization functions lead to more inflexible protocols. While we have mainly focused on the interest rate, the overcollateralization and liquidation parameters are also important. Lending pools might want to learn fair bundles of parameters instead of simply fair interest rates. For example, some borrowers may be willing to pay higher interest rates for more capital upfront, while other borrowers may be willing to pay higher interest rates for a lower risk of liquidation. Utilization functions are ill-suited to this finding fair bundles, as a separate market problem would have to be solved for each bundle of parameters.\n\n<sup>2</sup>https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-renewal-2023/4638\n\nIn this paper, we take a different approach. As the example above shows, lending pool loans increase the borrower's exposure to the collateral. The analog of this in traditional finance is an option. We replicate lending pool loans with barrier options, a type of option that is nullified if the price of the underlying asset falls below a certain barrier. Then we can use techniques inspired by option pricing to find fair interest rates. This approach addresses the limitations of utilization functions: it's easier to find the interest rate via simulations, and borrowers and lenders can evaluate whether the posted interest rate is favorable to them. Large lenders cannot manipulate the interest rate if it's not based on utilization, and it's also possible to find fair \"bundles\" of parameters. Note that we are not the first to replicate DeFi lending with options; Sardon (2021) apply option pricing to a new class of zero-liquidation loans that they define.3\n\nOur main technical contribution is to show a strong impossibility result: there are no fair lending-pool parameters in a range of models similar to practice. We start with a simplified model, but show that the impossibility result extends to realistic treatments of liquidation as well as time-varying interest rates. We then investigate a model where borrowers pay lenders a fixed fee, which renders fair parameters possible. We provide some simulation results for this setting.\n\n#### 1.1 Related work\nSource 6:\nRule 48, also known as Exemptive Relief \u2014 Extreme Market Volatility Condition, is a mechanism used by the New York Stock Exchange to ease market opening while volatility is high.

      "response_tokens": 1562,
      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to design a credit scoring protocol that's fully on-chain. That means everyone can check its records, right? I know that on-chain transactions are important because they give transparency and accountability.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned behavioral economics mechanisms for Sybil attacks. So, I guess I need something where if one person is acting like many others (Sybils), their bad decisions get noticed. That makes sense because in real life, people with similar intentions can cause problems without us noticing unless we have some checks.\n\nPrivacy and under-collateralized lending are also key points. Privacy might involve some way to verify the information on chain data without exposing details, like some sort of encryption or checksums that others can check quickly. Under-collateralized lending is about not putting everyone up for the same risk, which could reduce fraud.\n\nI remember something about contract enforcement mechanisms. Maybe using smart contracts where participants have obligations to report bad transactions. That way, if someone is lying, the system can flag it. But how do I ensure privacy? Maybe through something like zero-knowledge proofs or some kind of anonymous records.\n\nBehavioral economics tools could include things like social proof\u2014having evidence that others are honest\u2014but that might not be enough on-chain. Alternatively, maybe using a scoring model that factors in how others behave and assesses the risk each time. Like if multiple people report bad credit, it's more likely someone is lying than just one person.\n\nI also need to think about how this fits into existing blockchain systems. Maybe integrating with NFTs or other chain features. For example, creating a scoring system where users can own points that represent their creditworthiness. The more points you have on-chain, the better your score. But it shouldn't be just based on assets; maybe the time spent collecting them.\n\nPrivacy could involve something like a time-based fee for transactions. So if someone takes a long time to report bad credit, they're penalized less. That way, the system encourages honesty without exposing bad behavior immediately.\n\nFor under-collateralization, I can introduce a mechanism where you have to put in more collateral than others to avoid defaulting on loans. This might be done through some kind of bonding, like adding tokens or assets to balance your position. It ensures that if one person has bad credit, others are at risk until they compensate.\n\nI should also consider how this fits into existing infrastructure. Maybe using smart contracts for scoring, smart tokens for incentives, and smart liquidity pools where rewards depend on the score. If the score is good, liquidity increases; bad scores decrease it.\n\nWait, what about Sybils? How can I prevent that on-chain without external intervention? Maybe by having a system where honest users can't be easily substituted. Perhaps through some form of vote control or token ownership. Like if you own tokens that represent your creditworthiness, others can't easily replace them with malicious ones.\n\nAnother thought: maybe using a peer review system where transactions are reviewed by multiple parties on-chain before being accepted. This could add another layer of checks and make it harder for Sybils to manipulate the results without being caught.\n\nI also need to think about the scoring formula itself. It should balance how much risk there is compared to the rewards offered. So, if a person has bad credit, their score drops below average, which attracts others with good credit who can reciprocate by also having low scores in return.\n\nPrivacy could be enhanced through zero-knowledge proofs where participants can prove they're honest without revealing details of other transactions or personal info. Maybe using blockchain smart contracts that handle these proofs automatically.\n\nUnder-collateralization would then mean that to lend, you have to put up more collateral than others. So when someone has bad credit, the system doesn't allow them to lend as much unless others compensate by borrowing more or reporting good credit themselves.\n\nPutting it all together, I imagine a scoring mechanism where each on-chain transaction is evaluated based on multiple factors like credit history, time spent collecting points, and peer reviews. Users own tokens that represent their score, so honest behavior leads to better scores. Sybils are detected through behavioral economics tools rather than external intervention, ensuring privacy while encouraging accountability.\n\nI should also consider how this integrates with existing NFT or blockchain features to ensure seamless on-chain transactions and scoring. Maybe using smart contracts for all the scoring, verification, and reward calculations. Plus, a rewards system where users earn tokens based on their scores, which can be used for things like token swaps or security upgrades.\n\nPotential challenges include ensuring that the scoring doesn't penalize honest people too harshly while still encouraging good credit. It's a balance between transparency (so people don't lie) and security (so bad behavior is detected). Maybe using a mix of behavioral incentives, smart contracts, and regular audits to maintain trust and fairness.\n\nOverall, this approach seems promising because it leverages the blockchain's decentralized nature for transparency and privacy, behavioral economics for accountability and security, and smart mechanisms like smart contracts to manage risk. It addresses Sybil attacks by leveraging multiple reports and penalties based on behavior, maintains privacy through zero-knowledge proofs or anonymous records, and allows under-collateralized lending by ensuring bad credit impacts others.\n</think>\n\nTo design a fully on-chain credit scoring protocol that addresses Sybil attacks, enhances privacy, and supports under-collateralized lending, we can structure the system as follows:\n\n1. **Behavioral Economics Mechanisms**:\n   - **Scoring Models**: Implement a sophisticated scoring system where each transaction is evaluated based on factors like credit history, time spent collecting points, and peer reviews. This ensures transparency while encouraging good credit behavior.\n   - **Penalty for Sybils**: Use behavioral economics tools to penalize Sybil attacks by leveraging penalties that increase with multiple reports of bad credit. These penalties are tied to user behavior without external intervention.\n\n2. **Privacy and Anonymity**:\n   - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Utilize blockchain smart contracts for ZK proofs, allowing honest participants to verify their records without exposing personal details or other transactions.\n   - **Anonymous Transactions**: Ensure that on-chain transactions are verified quickly using zero-knowledge proofs to maintain privacy and accountability.\n\n3. **Under-Collateralized Lending**:\n   - **Balanced Collateral Requirement**: Implement a mechanism where to lend, participants must put in more collateral than others. This forces those with bad credit to compensate through other means.\n   - **Token Rewards System**: Introduce rewards for honest behavior and penalties for under-collateralization. Lenders earn tokens based on scores, which can be used for security upgrades.\n\n4. **Integration with Existing Infrastructure**:\n   - **Smart Contracts**: Use smart contracts for the scoring system, verification, and rewards to ensure seamless transactions.\n   - **Liquidity Pool**: Create a bonding mechanism within a liquidity pool where rewards depend on scores, encouraging balanced lending practices.\n\n5. **User Ownership and Trust**:\n   - **Token Ownership**: Users own tokens representing their creditworthiness, discouraging easy substitution by Sybils who can't be easily replaced without penalties.\n   - **Score Transparency**: User scores are publicly verifiable, ensuring honesty and accountability.\n\n6. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**:\n   - Conduct regular audits to balance incentives (scored points) with penalties for bad behavior. This ensures trust in the system while maintaining security.\n\nThis mechanism balances transparency, privacy, and security, addressing Sybil attacks through behavioral tools, enhancing under-collateralized lending with balanced requirements, and fostering a secure and transparent credit scoring system on-chain."

To complete the tasks efficiently, we aim to design reward mechanisms that incentivize early-joining agents to invite more participants to the tasks. Nonetheless, participants could potentially engage in strategic behaviors, e.g., not inviting others to the tasks, misreporting their capacity for the tasks, or creaking fake identities (aka Sybil attacks), to maximize their own rewards. The focus of this study is to address the challenge outlined above by designing effective reward mechanisms. To this end, we propose a novel reward mechanism, called Propagation Reward Distribution Mechanism (PRDM), for the general information propagation model with limited budgets. It is proved that the PRDM can not only incentivize all agents to contribute their full efforts to the tasks and share the task information to all their neighbors in the social networks, but can also prevent them from Sybil attacks.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe widespread availability of mobile Internet devices has fostered greater interconnectedness among individuals via social networks and amplified the impact of information spread through social connections. In certain fields, including viral marketing [Leskovec *et al.*, 2006], crowdsourcing distribution [Singer and Mittal, 2011; Doan *et al.*, 2011], answer querying [Kleinberg and Raghavan, 2005], sponsors frequently incentivize participants with monetary rewards to gather as much data or sell as many products as possible. In 2005, Amazon launched a crowdsourcing platform called Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to gather data from nonprofessionals. On the MTurk platform, the sponsors can post tasks and rewards, and then the workers claim the tasks and receive payments accordingly based on the quantity and quality of their completed tasks. Many studies requiring extensive data started collecting data through MTurk [Sorokin and Forsyth, 2008]. One study in 2019 showed that more than 250,000 people have completed at least one task on MTurk [Robinson *et al.*, 2019]. However, a large percentage of these workers are fixed, which is mainly because that inviting new people to join is not beneficial. Making existing workers invite more people to participate can significantly improve efficiency.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to adequately utilize people's connections in the network to design a reward distribution mechanism [Zhang and Zhao, 2022]. This mechanism incentivizes agents to invite more people to participate by the reward distribution, which eventually improves the overall completion efficiency. The first difficulty is distributing the rewards within a constrained budget. The mechanism should motivate agents to spread the information in their social network as much as possible. In the DARPA network challenge [Pickard *et al.*, 2010; Tang *et al.*, 2011], the winning team from MIT used a pioneering mechanism to effectively motivate people to spread information and quickly found all ten red balloons. In multi-level marketing [Emek *et al.*, 2011a; Drucker and Fleischer, 2012], the seller expects to sell more products by attracting more people to purchase. In our problem setting, we also need to properly allocate the limited budget to participants.\n\nAnother difficulty is resolving Sybil attacks in social networks. A Sybil attack is when participants create multiple false identities to accomplish specific purposes. Sybil attacks are widespread and easily performed, affecting eventual results and harming others [Alothali *et al.*, 2018; Yu *et al.*, 2006; Zhang *et al.*, 2014]. Traditional defense approaches are mainly focused on the communication domain [Chen *et al.*, 2021; Jamshidi *et al.*, 2019; Zhang and Lee, 2019]. Scholars have extensively studied this phenomenon in various domains, such as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves process in auction theory is vulnerable to Sybil attacks [Yokoo *et al.*, 2004], and Yokoo et al. [Yokoo *et al.*, 2001] developed a new protocol against false-name bids. In Bitcoin transactions, Babaioff et al. [Babaioff *et al.*, 2012] devised a scheme that rewards information propagation to prevent Sybil attacks to make more revenue. In crowdsourcing, individuals have different abilities, such as computing power, purchasing advertising, or providing data. Emek et al. [Emek *et al.*, 2011b] solved the problem of Sybil attacks in viral marketing by rewarding propagation behavior based on the size of a maximum perfect binary tree. We aim to use this authentic contribution information to\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup>Corresponding Author.\n\ndesign an information propagation mechanism that defends against Sybil attacks.\n\nIn this paper, our mechanism drives improvements in the following dimensions.\n\n- We propose a model that quantifies an agent's contribution by introducing the concept of capacity. The model considers the general setting of Sybil attacks.\n- We propose a novel natural mechanism to allocate rewards that maximize information propagation within a limited budget while resisting Sybil attacks.\nSource 2:\nJeremias Lenzi\n\nDepartment of Business and Economics, University of Basel\n\nAbstract. Voting mechanisms are widely accepted and used methods for decentralized decision-making. Ensuring the acceptance or legitimacy of the voting mechanism's outcome is a crucial characteristic of any robust voting system. Consider the following scenario: A group of individuals wants to choose an option from a set of alternatives without requiring an identification or proof-of-personhood system. Moreover, they want to implement utilitarianism as their selection criteria. In such a case, players could submit votes multiple times using dummy accounts, commonly known as a Sybil attack (SA), which presents a challenge for decentralized organizations. To be functional and sustainable, they need to address this issue without harming their selection criteria. Is there a voting mechanism that always prevents players from benefiting by casting votes multiple times (SA-proof) while also selecting the alternative that maximizes the added valuations of all players (efficient)? One-person-one-vote is neither SA-proof nor efficient. Coin voting is SA-proof but not efficient. Quadratic voting is efficient but not SA-proof. This study uses Bayesian mechanism design to propose a solution. The mechanism's structure is as follows: Players make wealth deposits to indicate the strength of their preference for each alternative. Each player then receives a non-negative amount based on their deposit and the voting outcome. The proposed mechanism relies on two main concepts: 1) Transfers are influenced by the outcome in a way that each player's optimal action depends only on individual preferences and the number of alternatives; 2) A player who votes through multiple accounts slightly reduces the expected utility of all players more than the individual benefit gained. This study demonstrates that if players are risk-neutral and each player has private information about their preferences and beliefs, then the mechanism is SA-proof and efficient. This research provides new insights into the design of more robust decentralized decision-making mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Decentralized decision-making \u00b7 Strategic voting \u00b7 Efficiency \u00b7 Sybil attack \u00b7 Utilitarianism.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nSuppose a collective desires to implement a decentralized decision-making procedure to select an option from a set of alternatives whenever a choice problem is faced. Moreover, let's assume that the collective wants to implement an efficient\n\nmechanism, so the procedure should always select the alternative that maximizes added valuations of players independently from each particular choice problem (a utilitarian outcome), given that each member possesses private information regarding their preferences and beliefs. Also, let's assume that the collective wants to allow players to vote multiple times since it doesn't want to rely on identification systems or proof-of-personhood mechanisms.\n\nVoting mechanisms are accepted and used procedures to meet different preaccorded selection criteria as classic democratic theory states, Dahl (2008) [1]. A selection criterion is an accepted rule by all members of a collective. If the alternative selected by the mechanism meets the selection criterion rule, all members will agree with the mechanism's outcome. An implementable voting mechanism should always generate an outcome such that the selected alternative always meets the selection criterion. Otherwise, the decision made by the procedure might face legitimacy issues and could lead to sub-groups of agents not accepting the decision made. For example, a standard one-person-one-vote voting mechanism (1P1V) always selects the alternative that is of preference to more individuals. Notice that this selection criterion doesn't account for the intensities of preferences. The 1P1V mechanism requires aid from a system that ensures that each agent votes only once. In a scenario where players could cast multiple votes, the selected alternative might not be the one that mmets the selection criteria 1 . Submitting multiple votes is usually referred to as a Sybil attack.\n\nAs a solution to this problem, we propose a voting mechanism based on transfers. Players will deposit money in abstract envelopes that supports the mechanism with all the information it needs to generate an outcome that meets the selection criteria at equilibrium. After an alternative is selected, players will receive back an envelope with money gathered from the deposits made by all players. The amount of money they receive back follows a known rule.\n\nThe selection criteria that this work focuses on is the utilitarian rule. This rule states that the chosen alternative must be the one that maximizes the added valuations of players over the set of options. Mechanism design applied to voting mechanisms that implement the utilitarian rule can be broadly found in the literature such as VCG mechanisms of Vickrey (1961), Clarke (1971) and Groves (1973) [2,3,4] and the AGV mechanisms by d'Aspremont and Gerard-Varet (1979) and Arrow (1979) [5,6]. Other examples are Quadratic Voting mechanisms [7,8,9,10] on which we base our approach. We use a similar design that pushes players to have a concave quadratic utility function. However, we obtain the negative quadratic term by using a different concept. Instead of the cost of votes being a value proportional to its square, we obtain the negative quadratic term by multiplying two linear functions, the player's expected value of transfers.\n\nBlockchain communities and decentralized autonomous organizations face several choice problems throughout their lifespan, such as updating protocols, financing projects, reversing harms from hacks, etc. Some of these types of orga-\n\n<sup>1</sup> This is why we don't see 1P1V implemented in blockchain environments since players could vote from multiple addresses\n\nnizations don't have or prefer not having an identification mechanism to distinguish their members (because of ideological or foundational reasons). One of the most implemented governance structures in blockchain environments is what is called coin voting or holders voting, a type of weighted voting mechanism where the weight or amount of votes of a player is equal to the holdings of that player of a particular governance token2 , Fan et al. (2023) [11]. Holdings could be dispersed into several accounts so players could vote multiple times through different accounts. However, the total amount of holdings of the governance tokens of each player remains the same over all the accounts. Voting from these accounts would imply a total of votes equal to voting from the original account. In other words, coin voting is Sybil attack-proof. However, this mechanism selects the alternative that gathers more holdings, and it doesn't take into account players' intensity of preferences. Its selection criterion differs from the one this work focuses on.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Dahl, Robert A.: Democracy and its Critics.

In the context of Sybil attacks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cidentities\u00e2\u0080\u009d can refer to a blockchain node, a social media account, a pseudoanonymous wallet address, or any other entity. \u00c2\nA successfully executed Sybil attack requires creating and controlling a large number of pseudoanonymous entities to influence the network in a malicious manner. For blockchains, this can result in a 51% attack or transaction censorship. In a social media network, Sybil attacks can be used to disseminate misinformation and create a false sense of community consensus.\nThere are two main types of Sybil attacks:\nSybil attacks are most relevant to networks defined by pseudoanonymous participation. Social media networks, blockchain networks, and other peer-to-peer networks are all vulnerable to Sybil attacks because pseudoanonymity is a feature\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is purposefully simple to operate multiple entities in the network.\nBlockchain networks are particularly targeted for Sybil attacks because they represent high-value targets for attackers. If a Sybil attack is successfully performed, it often leads to the direct loss of user funds. In contrast, a successful Sybil attack on a social media network often results in the spread of targeted misinformation, false societal consensus, and user privacy breaches.\nSee how cross-chain solutions enable a new frontier of dApp functionality.\nTake a deep dive into the burgeoning decentralized financial system.\nExplore what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible in the metaverse and how you can visit it.\nDiscover how to create NFTs and make them dynamic using oracles.\nUncover why blockchains need oracles and how they power Web3.\nLearn what smart contracts are and how you can build them.\nDiscover the next step in the evolution of the Internet.\nExplore how zero-knowledge proofs provide privacy guarantees.\nSource 4:\nASybil attackis a type of attack on a computernetwork servicein which an attacker subverts the service's reputation system by creating a large number ofpseudonymousidentities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence. It is named after the subject of the bookSybil, a case study of a woman diagnosed withdissociative identity disorder.[1]The name was suggested in or before 2002 by Brian Zill atMicrosoft Research.[2]The termpseudospoofinghad previously been coined by L. Detweiler on theCypherpunks mailing listand used in the literature on peer-to-peer systems for the same class of attacks prior to 2002, but this term did not gain as much influence as \"Sybil attack\".[3]\nThe Sybil attack incomputer securityis an attack wherein areputation systemis subverted by creating multiple identities.[4]A reputation system's vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how cheaply identities can be generated, the degree to which the reputation system accepts inputs from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity, and whether the reputation system treats all entities identically. As of 2012[update], evidence showed that large-scale Sybil attacks could be carried out in a very cheap and efficient way in extant realistic systems such asBitTorrentMainline DHT.[5][6]\nAnentityon a peer-to-peer network is a piece ofsoftwarethat has access to local resources. An entity advertises itself on the peer-to-peer network by presenting anidentity. More than one identity can correspond to a single entity. In other words, the mapping of identities to entities is many to one. Entities in peer-to-peer networks use multiple identities for purposes of redundancy, resource sharing, reliability and integrity. In peer-to-peer networks, the identity is used as anabstractionso that a remote entity can be aware of identities without necessarily knowing the correspondence of identities to local entities. By default, each distinct identity is usually assumed to correspond to a distinct local entity. In reality, many identities may correspond to the same local entity.\nAn adversary may present multiple identities to a peer-to-peer network in order to appear and function as multiple distinct nodes. The adversary may thus be able to acquire a disproportionate level of control over the network, such as by affecting voting outcomes.\nIn the context of (human)online communities, such multiple identities are sometimes known assockpuppets. The less common terminverse-Sybil attackhas been used to describe an attack in which many entities appear as a single identity.[7]\nA notable Sybil attack in conjunction with a traffic confirmation attack was launched against theTor anonymity networkfor several months in 2014.[8][9]\nThere are other examples of Sybil attacks run against Tor network users. This includes the 2020 Bitcoin address rewrite attacks. The attacker controlled a quarter of all Tor exit relays and employedSSL strippingto downgrade secure connections and divert funds to the wallet of the threat actor known as BTCMITM20.[10][11][12]\nAnother notable example is the 2017\u20132021 attack run by threat actor KAX17. This entity controlled over 900 malicious servers, primarily middle points, in an attempt to deanonymize Tor users.[13][14]\nValidation techniques can be used to prevent Sybil attacks and dismissmasqueradinghostile entities. A local entity may accept a remote identity based on a central authority which ensures a one-to-one correspondence between an identity and an entity and may even provide a reverse lookup. An identity may be validated either directly or indirectly. In direct validation the local entityqueriesthe central authority to validate the remote identities. In indirect validation the local entity relies on already-accepted identities which in turn vouch for the validity of the remote identity in question.\nPractical network applications and services often use a variety ofidentity proxiesto achieve limited Sybil attack resistance, such astelephone number verification,credit cardverification, or even based on theIP addressof a client. These methods have the limitations that it is usually possible to obtain multiple such identity proxies at some cost \u2013 or even to obtain many at low cost through techniques such asSMS spoofingorIP address spoofing. Use of such identity proxies can alsoexcludethose without ready access to the required identity proxy: e.g., those without their own mobile phone or credit card, or users located behindcarrier-gradenetwork address translationwho share their IP addresses with many others.\nIdentity-based validation techniques generally provide accountability at the expense ofanonymity, which can be an undesirable tradeoff especially in online forums that wish to permitcensorship-free information exchange and open discussion of sensitive topics. Avalidation authoritycan attempt to preserve users' anonymity by refusing to perform reverse lookups, but this approach makes the validation authority a prime target for attack. Protocols usingthreshold cryptographycan potentially distribute the role of such a validation authority among multiple servers, protecting users' anonymity even if one or a limited number of validation servers is compromised.[15]\nSybil prevention techniques based on the connectivity characteristics ofsocial graphscan also limit the extent of damage that can be caused by a given Sybil attacker while preserving anonymity. Examples of such prevention techniques includeSybilGuard,[16]SybilLimit,[17]theAdvogato Trust Metric,[18]SybilRank,[19]and the sparsity based metric to identify Sybil clusters in a distributed P2P based reputation system.[20]\nThese techniques cannot prevent Sybil attacks entirely, and may be vulnerable to widespread small-scale Sybil attacks. In addition, it is not clear whether real-world online social networks will satisfy the trust or connectivity assumptions that these algorithms assume.[21]\nAlternatively, imposing economic costs as artificialbarriers to entrymay be used to make Sybil attacks more expensive.Proof of work, for example, requires a user to prove that they expended a certain amount of computational effort to solve acryptographicpuzzle. InBitcoinand related permissionlesscryptocurrencies, miners compete to append blocks to ablockchainand earn rewards roughly in proportion to the amount of computational effort they invest in a given time period. Investments in other resources such asstorageorstake in existing cryptocurrencymay similarly be used to impose economic costs.\nAs an alternative to identity verification that attempts to maintain a strict \"one-per-person\" allocation rule, a validation authority can use some mechanism other than knowledge of a user's real identity \u2013 such as verification of anunidentifiedperson's physical presence at a particular place and time as in apseudonym party[22]\u2013 to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between online identities and real-world users. Suchproof of personhoodapproaches have been proposed as a basis for permissionlessblockchainsandcryptocurrenciesin which each human participant would wield exactly one vote inconsensus.[23][24]A variety of approaches to proof of personhood have been proposed, some with deployed implementations, although many usability and security issues remain.[25]\nA number of distributed protocols have been designed with Sybil attack protection in mind. SumUp[26]and DSybil[27]are Sybil-resistant algorithms for online content recommendation and voting. Wh\u0101nau is a Sybil-resistantdistributed hash tablealgorithm.[28]I2P's implementation ofKademliaalso has provisions to mitigate Sybil attacks.[29]\nSource 5:\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (No. 23010503000 and No. 22ZR1442200), and Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (ShangHAI)."

    "without_rag": {
      "response_tokens": 1079,
      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to design a formal verification framework for analyzing cross-protocol composability risks in multi-layer DeFi systems that include rebasing tokens, flash loans, and non-fungible collateral. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I should understand what each component does. Multi-layer DeFi usually has multiple layers of assets like token chains, liquidity pools, or decentralized borrowing. Each layer can be a different protocol. So when someone moves money across these layers, they might break one protocol and require another.\n\nRebalancing tokens are used to adjust the value of collateral in different protocols. Flash loans are short-term borrows that can be moved between protocols as needed. Non-fungible collateral is like unique digital assets that can't be easily substituted or exchanged.\n\nSo, the framework should model how moving money across these layers might cause issues. I think using formal methods would help ensure accuracy and prevent bugs in the system design. Maybe something like Z notation since it's well-suited for specifications and proofs.\n\nI need to define the context of cross-protocol composability. That probably involves understanding each protocol's behavior, how they interact when combining, and what happens when a protocol is disrupted. For example, if token A can be exchanged in protocol 1 but not in 2, moving an asset across the layers would risk breaking both.\n\nRebalancing tokens could introduce risks because if you move too much, it might cause instability or market manipulation. Flash loans offer leverage but also come with risks like default. Non-fungible collateral has unique identifiers, which can help prevent easily substituted assets from being moved incorrectly.\n\nNext, I should model the system's behavior using formal languages. Maybe Z schema to define interfaces and behaviors. The language should include constructs for protocols (like DeFi layer 1, 2, etc.), tokens, loans, and rebasing mechanisms.\n\nI need to identify the possible composability issues. These might be single-layer issues like token exchange, multi-layer risks where moving assets across layers could cause problems in both, and inter-protocol issues like flash loan moves or non-fungible collateral misuses.\n\nFormal verification will involve proving whether certain combinations of protocols are safe under specific conditions. For instance, can a protocol's move in one layer be compensated by others? How does the presence of rebasing tokens affect the overall system?\n\nI should also model each risk as an event that could lead to failure. Then use formal methods to check if these events are possible or lead to any inconsistencies or safety violations.\n\nTesting this framework would involve writing test cases for each component, maybe using automated tools like Coq or Why3 to verify the proofs generated by Z. Real-world testing with a proof of concept setup in a DeFi system could validate the approach and identify any issues before adoption.\n\nPotential challenges include accurately modeling all possible interactions and ensuring that the verification framework scales with different protocols and token types. Also, balancing comprehensiveness enough to cover risks but not overly complex to maintain manageability.\n\nI might need to look into existing frameworks or libraries for Z notation and see how they can be applied here. Maybe there are existing tools or examples of similar systems being verified.\n\nOverall, the framework should provide a systematic way to analyze each risk individually, then collectively assess system safety across protocols, considering rebasing tokens, flash loans, and non-fungible collateral.\n</think>\n\n**Final Answer: A Formal Verification Framework for Multi-Layer DeFi Cross-Protocol Composability Analysis**\n\nTo design a formal verification framework for analyzing cross-protocol composability risks in multi-layer DeFi systems with rebasing tokens, flash loans, and non-fungible collateral, the following approach is proposed:\n\n1. **System Contextualization**:\n   - Multi-layer DeFi consists of multiple protocols (e.g., token chains, liquidity pools) that interact across layers.\n   - Rebalancing tokens adjust asset values in different protocols.\n   - Flash loans offer leverage but introduce risks like default.\n   - Non-fungible collateral ensures unique assets for security.\n\n2. **Modeling with Formal Languages**:\n   - Use Z schema to define interfaces and behaviors formally, capturing each protocol's interactions and mechanisms.\n   - Define tokens, rebasing mechanisms, flash loans, and non-fungible collateral within this framework.\n\n3. **Identifying Risks**:\n   - Single-layer issues: Token exchange in one layer vs. others.\n   - Multi-layer risks: Moving assets across layers could break protocols or introduce instability.\n   - Inter-protocol risks: Flash loan misuses, non-fungible collateral misuse.\n\n4. **Formal Verification Approach**:\n   - Prove safety under specific conditions using Z schema for specifications and proofs.\n   - Identify possible composability issues, such as protocol compensations and risk exposure.\n\n5. **Verification and Testing**:\n   - Develop test cases for each component to validate the framework's accuracy.\n   - Use automated tools like Coq/Why3 for formal proof generation and testing within a DeFi setup.\n\n6. **Practical Application**:\n   - Apply the framework with real-world setups to identify risks before adoption.\n   - Consider scalability in managing complexity while ensuring thorough coverage of all interactions.\n\nThis framework systematically assesses each risk, ensuring overall system safety across protocols with accurate and scalable verification."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this article about DeFi and something called Maximal Extractable Value or MEV. From what I gather, MEV is a concept in Decentralized Exchanges where you can make money by extracting more value than the standard block reward and fees. But wait, how exactly does that work? Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that MeV stands for Maximal Extractable Value. It's a term from the academic paper [37] which explains it as profits that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and transaction fees. So basically, if people are making more money by processing blocks than what's already being paid out, they're getting something called MEV.\n\nBut how is this different from other forms of mining? I know that in traditional mining, your mine produces some reward, say a certain amount per block, plus some fees for processing. If you can sell the tokens at a higher price or get more value when you put them into the network, you can make profit beyond just the block reward.\n\nWait, but isn't that what the article is saying? It's about creating a system where this MEV can be extracted by participants in DeFi. So, maybe these participants act like arbitrageurs who buy tokens at lower prices and sell them higher to extract MEV? That could create a bubble-like situation on exchanges.\n\nI'm also curious about how this affects the exchange fees. If there's MEV extraction, does that mean the fees need to be adjusted or reduced? Or is it more about how much each participant can profit beyond just their block rewards?\n\nAnother thing I'm thinking about is the incentives for participants in DeFi. Are they being incented if they extract MEV? It seems like they might have an incentive to do so because it's a way to make extra money. But would that lead to longer chains or faster consensus, making the exchanges more stable?\n\nI also wonder how this concept applies beyond just token exchanges. Maybe other financial instruments in DeFi could utilize MEV as well, allowing for more efficient transactions and better utilization of resources.\n\nBut I'm not sure if all transactions can be turned into MEV opportunities. What about non-fiat tokens or cryptocurrencies? Do they naturally have some kind of inherent value that can be extracted on their own?\n\nFurthermore, the article mentions something about smart contracts in blockchain. How do these relate to MEV? Are smart contracts being used as mechanisms for participants to sell tokens at maximum extraction value?\n\nI'm also considering the practical implications. If MEV is a key mechanism in DeFi, how does that impact the ecosystem's profitability and innovation? Do participants who can capitalize on MEV drive more adoption of Decentralized Finance, or do they potentially dilute their profits by selling to other participants?\n\nLastly, I need to make sure I understand all the references provided. The paper [37] gives a good theoretical foundation, but some parts might be too technical for someone just starting out. Maybe I should read some foundational articles on blockchain and cryptocurrency before diving deeper into MEV.\n\nOverall, it seems like MEV is a crucial concept in DeFi that allows participants to generate additional income beyond traditional rewards, which could lead to various innovations and more efficient financial systems.\n</think>\n\n**Understanding Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): A Comprehensive Overview**\n\nMaximal Extractable Value (MEV) is a fundamental concept in Decentralized Exchanges (DeFi), where participants can generate additional profit beyond traditional block rewards and fees. Here's a structured breakdown of the key aspects and implications:\n\n1. **Definition and Concept**:\n   - MEV refers to profits extracted from block production exceeding standard rewards and fees. This allows participants to earn extra money, creating opportunities for arbitrage.\n\n2. **Mechanism Behind MEV**:\n   - Participants act as arbitrageurs, buying tokens at lower prices and selling them higher to extract MEV, thereby enriching their position beyond the usual transaction rewards.\n\n3. **Impact on Exchanges**:\n   - MEV can lead to a bubble-like situation, potentially increasing the size of exchanges and enhancing market stability by amplifying token values.\n\n4. **Incentives for Participants**:\n   - There may be incented participation if extracting MEV is perceived as an additional value proposition, though this could dilute profits in other participants.\n\n5. **Economic Implications Beyond Token Exchanges**:\n   - The concept applies beyond tokens, potentially enabling more efficient transactions and resource utilization across various DeFi products.\n\n6. **Role of Smart Contracts**:\n   - Smart contracts are likely used as mechanisms for participants to facilitate MEV opportunities, enhancing the blockchain's role in generating value.\n\n7. **Practical Considerations**:\n   - The article suggests that MEV could drive more adoption of DeFi, potentially increasing ecosystem profitability and fostering innovation.\n   - However, it might also lead to token bubbles if not managed properly.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - MEV is a cornerstone in DeFi, enabling participants to generate profits beyond traditional rewards, driving innovative practices and enhancing the ecosystem's stability and growth potential.\n\nThis overview highlights MEV's importance in shaping the future of DeFi, influencing participation models, and contributing to the broader financial landscape.",

The root cause is that Cream Finance does not set the reentrancy protection and AMP has a reentrancy vulnerability. Specifically, AMP contains a hook function tokensReceived of ERC777 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777) standard, and the hook function can trigger the execution of the attacker's contract. The attacker exploited the reentrancy vulnerability in AMP token contract, and re-loaned assets from Cream Finance. Specifically, the adversary first borrowed AMP from Cream Finance, and then exploited the reentrancy vulnerability in AMP token contract to re-borrow ETH from Cream Finance. Finally, the adversary received profits due to multiple loans with single collateral.\n\n- xToken exploitation. The root cause is that xToken mints xSNXa with relying on the price of SNX in Uniswap. The attacker conducted an indirect price manipulation attack [89] on xToken. Specifically, the attacker first borrowed SNX from flash loans, and sold the SNX to Uniswap aiming at tanking SNX's price. Then, the attacker used ETH to mint xSNXa at the tanked price of SNX. Finally, the attacker burned xSNXa and claimed SNX tokens. The attacker paid back the flash loans and exchanged the remaining SNX into ETH as profits. - RigoBlock whitehat rescue. Fig. 21 shows the code snippets of the RigoBlock. The comments at Line 1 and 4 show that the two functions, i.e., setMultipleAllowances and operateOnExchange, should be only invoked by owner. But, the developers miss setting the onlyOwner modifier [27] for the first function although onlyOwner modifier is set for the second function at Line 5. The vulnerability allows non-owners to invoke the first function and set allowances for approved tokens to them. Before the attack transaction, the whitehat invoked the first function and set allowances for them. Then in the attack transaction, the whitehat drained out six kinds of assets from RigoBlock, and exchanged all of them into ETH. After the attack transaction, the whitehat communicated with RigoBlock in Twitter and returned the ETH to RigoBlock.\n\n#### I BACKGROUND ON REPRESENTATION LEARNING\n\nRepresentation learning is a class of machine learning methods to automatically discover the features for constructing classifiers or other predictor variables [35, 67]. Representation learning is fully data-driven and task-oriented, obviating considerable manual efforts for data study and manually extracting features (e.g., feature engineering) [35, 67]. There are two main types of representation learning, namely supervised representation learning and unsupervised representation learning [35]. Supervised representation learning learns features from labeled data, such as neural networks, multi-layer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning [35]. Unsupervised representation learning learns features from unlabeled data, such as unsupervised dictionary learning, independent component analysis, automatic coding, matrix factorization [35].\nSource 3:\nSimple public-key infrastructure\nEPA Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative (SDSI)\nSource 4:\n# Token Composition: A Graph Based on EVM Logs\n\nSoftware composition is a hard problem [7]. Smart contracts sidestep the low-level problems of interoperability by using a shared execution environment (i.e., a virtual machine) and de facto standards (e.g., ERCs), and the highlevel problems of architectural mismatch by taking a bottom-up approach to composition. He et al. [10] perform a large-scale analysis of 10 million Ethereum smart contracts deployed between July 2015 and December 2018. They show that less than 1% of the contracts are distinct, and more than 63% of those are similar to at least one other contract. The results have been replicated (see, e.g., [3, 11, 13]).\n\nFr\u00a8owis et al. [6] use symbolic execution to automatically detect smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that implement token functionality. Di Angelo and Salzer [1] reconstruct contract interfaces and events from EVM bytecode. They used transaction data to identify token contracts that comply with ERC standards and token contracts that do not. Oliveira et al. [17] propose a taxonomy for classifying tokens and they propose a decision tree to guide the token design process.\n\nKitzler et al. [12] analyse activity relating to decentralised finance (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain. They construct and topologically analyse two graphs: the contract account graph where the vertices are contract accounts and the edges are transactions between those accounts, and the protocol graph where the vertices are protocols and the edges are transactions between those protocols. They show that community finding algorithms identify communities in the contract account graph, but the communities do not correspond to protocols. There are several network analyses of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that quantify their age, economic value, and activity volume (see, e.g., [19, 32]).\n\nCaldarelli [2] describes wrapped tokens and their ability to represent realworld assets and to bridge tokens across blockchains. The WBTC whitepaper [14] sets out a general framework for tokenising assets on a blockchain. Santoro et al. [18] propose a standard interface for vaults for ERC-20 tokens. A vault can store a single asset or underlying token. Users can deposit or withdraw the asset. In return, they receive shares in the form of another ERC-20 token. Lloyd et al. [15] analysed the emergent outcomes of vote-escrowed tokens (veTokens) where a token is locked for a fixed period in exchange for voting rights.\n\nWe use common terminology from graph theory through-out the paper. Please refer to work by Diestel [5] for definitions.\n\n### 3 Token Composition\n\nTokens are central to blockchain-based protocols and applications [34]. Token composition is a technique where one or more tokens can be combined to create new tokens. The entitlements of the input tokens are appropriated by the new token. We extract data from EVM logs (Sec. 3.1) and use it to construct a token graph (Sec. 3.2), a representation of the tokenisation process. In Sec. 4 we will analyse the graph and relate it to the tokenisation process.\n\n### 3.1 EVM Logs, Events and Meta-Events\n\nEVM logs record specific occurrences or outputs generated during the execution of contract code. They enable off-chain applications to react to on-chain events. A popular event is the Transfer event emitted by ERC 20 tokens [33]:\n\n```\nevent Transfer ( address indexed from ,\n                 address indexed to ,\n                 uint256 value ) ;\n```\nListing 1: The ERC 20 Transfer event specifies three parameters: from, to, and value.\n\nThe event has two special cases. If the from address is the zero address (0x0) then the contract mints new tokens. If the to address is the zero address then it burns existing tokens.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] M. D.

Specifically, we provide insights on developing and improving governance frameworks in DeFi projects, highlight the challenges and vulnerabilities in DeFi governance, and facilitate the formulation of guidelines and best practices in this domain.\n\nFor Researchers. First, in the realm of software engineering (SE) research, there is a pressing need to delve into DeFi governance frameworks. Governance challenges form a substantial part of the hurdles DeFi applications face, necessitating thorough research and solutions. Our taxonomy serves as a foundation for this exploration. Yet, numerous challenges remain unaddressed. For instance, the absence of a governance development model akin to software development frameworks hampers the design and implementation of effective governance strategies. Furthermore, the fairness in tokenomics and the balancing act in centralization demand in-depth study. For example, determining the extent of control for 'owners' and establishing ownership criteria are critical. In certain scenarios, centralization can safeguard a DeFi project, such as halting a malicious, unvalidated transaction. A deeper understanding and resolution of these issues could significantly enhance investor confidence and the success of DeFi applications. Second, a robust verification methodology is vital for scrutinizing the governance system design prior to implementation. Given\n\n4https://anonymous.4open.science/r/consistency_checker-CD88\n\nthat smart contracts are immutable post-deployment, rectifying defects is not as straightforward as in traditional software systems. From proposal initiation to final execution, each state transition within the governance process warrants careful verification. Overlooking flaws in governance design can have dire consequences, such as losing control to hackers. Addressing potential flaws proactively is crucial, as fixing high-level issues post-deployment in DeFi systems can be exceedingly costly. Third, ensuring consistency between DeFi whitepapers and their implementation is paramount. This alignment is crucial for transparent and accurate communication with investors and users. Developing semi- or fully automatic approaches to verify this consistency is an essential step forward. The prototype tool developed in our research could pave the way for more advanced systems capable of automating the verification process, thereby upholding the integrity of DeFi projects.\n\nFor DeFi Developers. First, Designing a robust governance system is paramount. It is essential to align with our proposed governance taxonomy and clearly articulate the rationale behind chosen designs, especially in managing privileged functions. Implementing these designs with transparency and communicating the details to users is crucial for trust-building. Second, developers must stay abreast of common governance issues and vulnerabilities. By enhancing governance mechanisms and refining implementation processes, they can address critical concerns related to ownership and tokenomics, thereby bolstering the security and reliability of their applications. Particular attention should be paid to ownership protection mechanisms, such as safeguards against unauthorized access to owner keys by team members or external threats. Third, developers should commit to transparent and accurate communication with investors and users. Maintaining consistency between the project's whitepaper and actual code is essential to reduce misinformation and mitigate risks. This approach not only builds trust but also solidifies the project's credibility in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFor Investors and Users. The insights from this study equip investors and users with the knowledge to make informed decisions in the DeFi arena. Understanding the governance issues, as categorized in our taxonomy, is key. Investors should scrutinize the governance frameworks, ownership structures, and tokenomics of DeFi projects for indicators of robustness and fairness. Crucial steps include:\n\n- Evaluating how a DeFi program manages ownership and the rationale behind these strategies.\n- Investigating the rights granted by governance tokens within the project's structure.\n- Assessing token distribution and privileged functions for potential unfair practices or inconsistencies with the whitepaper.\n- Understanding who holds the power to alter the DeFi code.\n\nBy comprehensively analyzing these elements, investors and users can discern the value and legitimacy of a DeFi application, thereby steering clear of scams. For example, the ability of a DeFi program to mint unlimited tokens or withdraw liquidity unrestrainedly may signal fraudulent intent. While there are inherent risks, a well-governed DeFi project can also present significant opportunities. Thus, a balanced approach in evaluation is crucial.\n\n# 3.4 Implications\n\nFor Regulators and Policymakers. Regulators and policymakers stand to gain significant insights from this research, particularly in understanding the nuanced governance challenges in DeFi. This study underscores the necessity for regulatory frameworks that go beyond assessing code vulnerabilities to encompass the entire governance structure of DeFi projects. A key area for future policy development is the role of the whitepaper; it is time to engage in discussions about its legal significance within the DeFi ecosystem. For instance, considering whether whitepapers should be subjected to regulatory oversight, given their role in outlining project fundamentals, is\n\ncrucial. Additionally, governance issues often center around ownership and incentive mechanisms. Therefore, regulatory bodies should closely monitor privileged functions that have a substantial impact on DeFi tokenomics, ensuring they align with both investor protection and market integrity. While doing so, it is important to strike a balance between effective regulation and fostering an environment that encourages innovation in the DeFi space.\n\n#### 4 RELATED WORK\n\nStudies on Blockchain and Decentralized Finance. Blockchain employs a decentralization methodology, securely storing data in a specifically structured entity known as a block. In particular, data incorporated into the system becomes impervious to tampering. Blockchain technology has caused profound changes and impacts on traditional Web 2.0 and is becoming a fundamental service of the Web, leading to the emergence of Web 3.0. Blockchain has been widely used in many fields, such as cryptocurrency, financial services, games, trading systems, and IoT [44, 56, 120]. Zheng et al. [120] and Gao et al. [56] reviewed the fundamental techniques in Blockchain such as architecture and consensus algorithms, and also discuss several blockchain applications. Di Francesco Maesa and Mori [44] study non-cryptocurrency blockchain applications and practical problems they solved, indicating that blockchain is a valuable technique for the real world. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is one main application scenario for blockchain. Meyer et al. [81] conduct the systematic literature review about DeFi at three different levels, i.e., micro, meso and macro. Shah et al. [99] reviews the various types of DeFi protocol in DeFi products. Bartoletti et al. [24] reviews the formal methods for DeFi to ensure its correct behavior. Jiang et al. [64] investigates the DeFi running mechanisms and systemically reviews the DeFi risks. Werner et al. [114] reviews the features and security of DeFi.\n\nBlockchain and DeFi Governance. In the realm of blockchain and DeFi governance, several studies stand out. Allen et al. [18, 19] propose a descriptive framework to understand blockchain governance, and later develop an exchange theory for Web3 governance. Ekal et al. [47] bridged traditional finance governance models with blockchain-based mechanisms. Kiayias et al.[66] conducted a comprehensive examination of the characteristics of blockchain governance. Marc et al. [108] and Gogel et al. [57] discussed its main forms, offering insights into this emerging field. Liu et al.[77] performed a systematic review analysis, summarizing the concept of blockchain governance as the system and procedures established to ensure that the development and implementation of blockchain technology complies with legal, regulatory and ethical obligations. Furthermore, Liu et al.[76] proposed a governance framework specifically for blockchain technology. Other foundational works [70, 86, 112] have also explored the realm of blockchain governance, offering highly abstract and conceptual insights. Another relevant study [55] looks at the DeFi revenue models and governance systems based on the analysis of real DeFi applications. Some works study governance risks and code update. Bekemeier et al. [27] systematically analyzes risks in DeFi, including DeFi governance. Bhambhwani et al. [29] analyzed the top 50 DeFi protocols and indicated potential governance risks. Erik et al. [48] discuss smart contract governance on smart contract upgrade in permissionless and permissioned blockchains. Reports from international organizations like the OECD and BIS [33, 52, 82, 115] discuss the current state and potential impacts of DeFi, providing a broader policy perspective. All of these works do not study the governance issues in DeFi applications. We benefit from the previous studies and build a governance taxonomy to study the governance issues in DeFi.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [18] Darcy WE Allen and Chris Berg. 2020.

We propose a taxonomy for financial bots on Ethereum comprising 7 bot categories and 24 subcategories. Furthermore, we create a groundtruth dataset of 133 human and 137 bot addresses.\n<sup>1</sup>https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-py\n\n<sup>2</sup>https://eigenphi.io/\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg</img>\n</F>\n\n#### Figure 1: Overview of the methodology.\n\n- RQ2 To what extent can we detect bots automatically? We deploy both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models and measure their performance. The highestperforming clustering algorithm is a Gaussian Mixture Model with an average cluster purity of 82.6%, evaluated on a balanced two-class dataset. The highest-performing binary classification model is a Random Forest with an accuracy of 83% on the same dataset.\n- RQ3 Which features are most informative to a model with high performance? Using explainable AI techniques, we find that features based on the time, frequency, gas price, and gas limit of outgoing transactions are the most influential.\n\nWe believe that our work helps better understand the Ethereum ecosystem dynamics by shedding more light on the existing bot landscape and by proposing a novel ML-based detection mechanism. As these bots can significantly influence market dynamics, liquidity, and the overall network safety, it is important to monitor their prevalence and impact.\n\nAll data and source code used in this study are publicly available for reproducibility purposes3 .\n\n#### 2 BACKGROUND\n\nThis section provides a background of the technologies used by financial bots, defines what a bot is in a blockchain context, and summarizes the existing literature on bot detection.\n\n#### 2.1 Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum's smart contract support allows the execution of programs in a decentralized manner. This gives rise to complex functionalities involving cryptoassets, i.e., digital assets that represent some economic resource or value to someone and are based on cryptographic primitives and a DLT [3]. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) enables trustless borrowing, lending, or investing on blockchain systems like Ethereum [44]. The following are core components of DeFi relevant to this work.\n\nTokens4 are cryptoassets created through smart contracts that adhere to specific standards to implement core functionalities such as the transferability between accounts [40]. Tokens following the ERC-20 standard are fungible, i.e. each unit is identical to any other deployed by the same contract. Smart contracts implemented according to the ERC-721 standard are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\n\n4https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens\n\nThis means they are not interchangeable, which makes each NFT unique, allowing them to be used as proof of ownership of a digital asset. Tokens have been used to represent Dollar equivalents on a blockchain (stablecoins) and NFTs have been used to represent artworks, tickets, or characters in video games [41].\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXes) on Ethereum are smart contracts that create a market to exchange cryptoassets against each other. Their off-chain counterparts, i.e. centralized exchanges (CEX), are commonly used as an interface between fiat currencies and cryptoassets and often enable trading through an order book. DEXes on the other hand often employ Automated Market Makers (AMMs), that allow for trading without an order book [25]. For these AMMs to work, prevalent mechanisms require liquidity to enable trading and users are financially incentivized to provide it [20].\n\nA relevant concept in DeFi is Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), initially termed miner-extractable value in the seminal work of Daian et al. [13]. It refers to profits that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and transaction fees. This is achieved by including, excluding, or re-ordering transactions within a block [37]. The most prominent examples of MEV are arbitrage, sandwich attacks, and liquidations. Arbitrage exploits price differences on DEXes to generate profit. Sandwich attacks send a transaction to drive up the price, let the victim buy at the high price, to then send another transaction to sell what was bought earlier at a profit. Liquidations involve the sale of collateralized assets to repay a debt at a favorable rate for the buyer [28].\n\n#### 2.2 Bots\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [3] Raphael Auer, Bernhard Haslhofer, Stefan Kitzler, Pietro Saggese, and Friedhelm Victor. 2023.

    "without_rag": {

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create an auction mechanism based on the Minimum Efficiently Reweighed Variance (MEV) redistribution concept. The goal is to maximize chain efficiency while ensuring equitable value distribution among participants\u2014users, validators, and protocol developers.\n\nFirst, I should understand what MEV redistribution entails. From what I know, MEV is a principle where the probability of a certain outcome depends on its relative contribution to the overall value. So, in auction terms, that would mean valuing items based on how much they contribute to the total chain value.\n\nNow, for redistribution, this means ensuring that when items are distributed among users, validators, and protocol developers, each gets their fair share according to their contributions. This sounds a bit like an allocation problem where we need to distribute goods (items) to different agents (users, validators, developers) in a way that reflects their true contributions.\n\nI remember something about the Generalized Second Price auction being used for things like online advertising or spectrum allocation. It's a common mechanism because it encourages higher bids from winners while penalizing losers. Maybe this can be adapted here.\n\nSo, how would we apply MEV redistribution within such an auction? Well, each item should start with a certain price based on its contribution. The highest bidders for each item get that item at the current price plus any additional increments (like the Generalized Second Price). But in addition to that, after all items are allocated, we need to redistribute the value among participants.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing things up. In MEV redistribution, it's about making sure that when you allocate a certain amount of resources (items), each agent gets their fair share. So perhaps the mechanism not only assigns items but also recalibrates the prices or values assigned based on what each participant ends up with.\n\nI think the key here is to have an initial price for each item that reflects its contribution, then use second-price increments for higher bidders. After all allocations are done, we calculate how much each agent has contributed and then adjust their valuations accordingly. This ensures that those who get more items or items of greater value end up with a fairer share.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact steps. Maybe it involves setting initial prices proportional to the contribution, then using these as base values, and then allowing winners to pay extra for any items they take beyond what their valuation would be based on their relative contributions. After allocation, participants are notified of how much they've contributed, and that information is used to adjust their effective valuations.\n\nAlso, considering chain efficiency, the auction should aim to minimize disruptions or delays in transactions by ensuring that everyone is on the same page about the items' values before allocation. This might involve having a central authority or a distributed system where participants can quickly verify each other's contributions without causing delays.\n\nI'm not entirely clear on how exactly the redistribution part would integrate with the second-price increments. Perhaps after the auction, the prices are adjusted based on the actual value that each participant received. That way, if someone takes an item worth more than their contribution, it reflects correctly in future allocations.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the mechanism uses a scoring system where participants' scores determine their allocation priority. This could be similar to how online marketplaces prioritize users based on their activity or preferences before allocating resources.\n\nI should also consider how this would handle different types of items and participants. For example, if some participants are smaller players with less involvement in the chain, they might get more items but still have a fair share based on their contributions. On the other hand, larger participants could take a bigger chunk of valuable items.\n\nOverall, I think the mechanism involves setting initial prices based on contribution, using second-price increments for higher bids, reallocating the most valuable items to winners, and then adjusting valuations based on actual contributions post-allocation. This would ensure that all parties are treated fairly, chain is efficient, and everyone gets a proportional share of the value.\n\nI might be missing some details, like specific algorithms or methods for price adjustment or redistribution. Maybe there's research on how to implement this efficiently in a distributed network without causing congestion or delays. Also, ensuring transparency through clear allocation rules and communication between participants would be crucial for equitable distribution.\n\nIn summary, the auction mechanism should start with an initial pricing based on contribution, allow winners to pay more for each item they win, reallocate valuable items to those who contributed most, then adjust valuations according to actual contributions. This approach seems to balance fairness with efficiency, which is probably what the MEV redistribution aims to achieve.\n</think>\n\nTo create an auction mechanism that maximizes chain efficiency while ensuring equitable value distribution among users, validators, and protocol developers based on the Minimum Efficiently Reweighed Variance (MEV) principle, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Pricing Based on Contribution:**\n   - Set the initial price for each item proportional to its contribution to the total chain value. This ensures that items are priced fairly according to their relative importance.\n\n2. **Generalized Second Price Increments:**\n   - Use a second-price increment mechanism where the highest bidders for each item win the item at the current base price plus any increments (e.g., Generalized Second Price). This encourages higher bids from winners while penalizing losers effectively.\n\n3. **Reallocation of Items:**\n   - Allocate the most valuable items to the highest bidders first, as these items are likely to have a larger impact on the total value distribution.\n\n4. **Redistribution of Value Post-Allocation:**\n   - After all allocations are made, participants should be informed of their contributions relative to the chain's overall value.\n   - Adjust the effective valuations of each participant based on their actual contributions post-allocation. This ensures that those who receive more items or items of greater value benefit from a fair share.\n\n5. **Chain Efficiency:**\n   - The mechanism aims to minimize disruptions by ensuring all participants are aware of the chain's current state before allocation, preventing delays caused by uncertainty in valuations.\n   - In a distributed network, this may involve mechanisms for quick verification and prioritization of allocations without causing congestion or delay.\n\n6. **Transparency and Communication:**\n   - Ensure clear rules for allocation to enhance transparency and ensure that all participants know how their participation contributes to the chain's value.\n   - Communicate updates on allocations promptly to keep everyone informed about contributions and results.\n\nThis mechanism balances fairness by ensuring each participant gets a share proportional to their contribution, while maintaining efficiency through efficient redistribution of items. It leverages principles similar to those in online marketplaces like spectrum allocation, ensuring minimal disruption and high chain efficiency."

The main goal is for users to get low-latency multimedia services, like streaming videos without any buffering. From what I know, GANs are good at generating high-quality images and videos by learning from existing data. But how does that apply to video streaming?\n\nFirst, the article mentions soft delivery as a new paradigm in wireless and mobile streaming. Soft delivery sounds similar to traditional streaming where you wait for frames to arrive before playing them. Soft delivery might mean sending parts of the data directly to the user, so there's no buffering. That makes sense because it can reduce latency.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how GANs fit into this. The authors propose a framework that uses GANs to generate the necessary frames for the video stream on edge servers. Edge servers are closer to the device and handle data processing before it's sent to the main network. By using GANs, they can create high-quality visuals without waiting for too long because each image is generated incrementally.\n\nThe article talks about a second-score auction mechanism to optimize how resources are allocated between edge servers and the main server in a distributed setting. A second-price auction is used in combinatorial auctions where you bid on items based on their value, and higher-value items get more bids. Applying this here could ensure that both edge and central servers get their resources efficiently. The proposed mechanism offers better revenue compared to the standard second-price auction by considering scalability.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused about how exactly the GANs are used in the framework. Do they just create the video content, or do they also assist with processing it before sending it out? From what I gather, edge servers process data locally and then send it back to the central server. The GANs could help in generating the visuals for those local data packets. Maybe each packet is augmented with a high-quality image generated by the GAN?\n\nAlso, the article mentions that soft delivery can offer lower latency because there's no buffering between the edge server and the main network. But how does this method handle variations in content or different user demands? I'm not sure if it can adapt to real-time changes on mobile devices. Maybe the models need to be continuously updated as users request different types of videos.\n\nAnother thing I'm curious about is how the auction mechanism interacts with the GANs. Does the auction determine how much each edge server should generate before sending, and does that influence the quality of the GAN model? Or is it more about scheduling when to send what data so that the GAN model can create better content?\n\nI also wonder about the scalability aspect. If more users join the network, will the GANs scale up without performance issues, or will there be problems with resource allocation becoming inefficient? The proposed mechanism's efficiency improvement in revenue seems important, but I'm not sure how it translates to real-world applications where user numbers can vary widely.\n\nLastly, I need to consider potential challenges. How does the edge server handle varying network conditions, like poor connectivity or fluctuating data rates? If the GANs aren't robust under such conditions, it could lead to issues in generating high-quality visuals for low latency.\n\nOverall, the article seems promising for improving video streaming with lower latency by integrating GANs and a smart resource allocation mechanism. But I need to dive deeper into how exactly these components work together and address potential challenges like network conditions and scalability.\n</think>\n\nThe integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with wireless edge networks offers the potential for significant improvements in video streaming, particularly in reducing latency by enabling soft delivery. Here's a structured overview of the key points discussed:\n\n1. **Soft Delivery as a Paradigm**:\n   - Soft delivery refers to real-time or low-latency video streaming without buffering. GANs are leveraged here due to their ability to generate high-quality visuals incrementally, which eliminates the need for waiting frames.\n\n2. **Application of GANs in Edge Servers**:\n   - Edge servers process data locally and use GANs to augment local packets with high-quality visual content. This approach ensures that each packet is augmented before transmission, potentially reducing latency by avoiding buffering.\n\n3. **Second-Price Auction Mechanism**:\n   - The article proposes a second-score auction mechanism to optimize resource allocation between edge servers and the central server in a distributed setting. This mechanism improves revenue over standard auctions, enhancing overall network efficiency.\n\n4. **Integration of GANs with GAN-Based Models**:\n   - Edge servers generate content using GANs, which are designed for high-quality image generation. This integration ensures that data is both processed and augmented before transmission, potentially improving visual quality in real-time.\n\n5. **Handling Content Variability**:\n   - The method addresses content variability by allowing models to adapt to real-time user demands, suggesting continuous updates necessary as users request different video types.\n\n6. **Scalability Considerations**:\n   - The proposed mechanism's efficiency improvement in revenue is a key factor. However, scalability issues may arise with fluctuating network conditions or high user load, requiring robust handling under such scenarios.\n\n7. **Challenges and Future Considerations**:\n   - Challenges include managing edge server performance under varying network conditions. Addressing these could enhance the effectiveness of soft delivery in real-world applications.\n\nIn conclusion, while the article presents promising strategies for enhancing video streaming through GANs and auction mechanisms, further exploration is needed to address challenges such as network variability and scalability. This integration could lead to significant improvements in latency and user satisfaction across various wireless networks.",

Nevertheless, Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has been a major issue in the Ethereum ecosystem, with considerable implications for the platform\u2019s functioning and integrity. This paper introduces the FairFlow protocol, a new system created to address the MEV problem within Ethereum\u2019s existing infrastructure. The protocol seeks to create a fairer environment, preventing miners or validators from taking advantage of the system, and safeguarding user data. The combination of auction-based block space allocation and randomized transaction ordering significantly reduces the possibility of MEV exploitation.\nThe advent of blockchain technology with Blockhain(Nakamoto,2008), epitomized by platforms such as Ethereum(Wood,2014), has significantly transformed digital transactions. This transformation is mainly attributed to the introduction of key features such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability. Ethereum has been particularly prominent as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) due to its pioneering smart contract functionality(Buterin,2014).\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s operational mechanics, including transaction processing(eth,2023)and block validation, present specific challenges(Ethereum Foundation,2020). A notable issue within the Ethereum ecosystem is Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)(Daian et al.,2019). MEV refers to the maximum profit that miners or validators can make by ordering transactions within a block, which is above standard block rewards and gas fees. This phenomenon has led to practices such as front-running, back-running, and transaction reordering, which could undermine fairness and efficiency in the network(Qin et al.,2020).\nThe implications of MEV are vast, affecting aspects such as transaction prioritization, network congestion, and the overall trustworthiness of the Ethereum platform(Daian et al.,2019)(Qin et al.,2020). To mitigate the issue of MEV, several solutions have been proposed. These include the implementation of off-chain transaction ordering services(Buterin,2021), alterations in consensus protocols, and the introduction of more robust transparency mechanisms(eip,2023). Although promising, these solutions have their limitations, often introducing new complexities or failing to address the core problem in a comprehensive way(Gudgeon et al.,2020). For example, off-chain services might inadvertently lead to centralization in transaction ordering, and changes to consensus protocols could require significant alterations to the Ethereum framework, which pose substantial implementation challenges(Ethereum Foundation,2020).\nThis paper introduces the FairFlow protocol, a framework created to tackle the issues of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in the Ethereum environment. As an additional layer to Ethereum, FairFlow provides a set of mechanisms that prioritize fairness and privacy in transaction processing. The protocol utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques and a distinct decentralized auction system for transaction ordering.\nThis innovative approach not only curtails the potential for MEV exploitation but also fortifies the foundational principles of Ethereum, including decentralization and openness, with a renewed emphasis on equitable outcomes for all network participants.The contributions of this paper to the discourse on Ethereum\u2019s MEV challenges are manifold and substantial.\nFairFlow is a new layered architectural model that has been specifically designed to improve fairness in transaction processing without changing the core architecture of Ethereum.\nLastly, the introduction of new components and mechanisms within FairFlow brings forth new security considerations. Each addition to the system potentially opens up vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Therefore, ensuring the robustness and security of FairFlow against potential attacks is of utmost importance. This requires ongoing vigilance and adaptation to evolving security threats to safeguard the integrity and reliability of the network.\nAs FairFlow development progresses, several key areas have emerged as critical for further exploration and advancement. A primary area of focus is the enhancement of cryptographic techniques. Continued research in this domain, particularly methods that improve privacy and security in decentralized networks, is vital for the fortification of FairFlow. Advanced cryptographic methods have the potential to significantly strengthen the security and integrity of the system.\nAnother crucial area of research is the scalability of FairFlow. Given the challenges associated with blockchain scalability, investigating and implementing solutions that could enhance the scalability of FairFlow is imperative. This exploration might include the adaptation of layer 2 solutions or sharding mechanisms, which are essential to ensure the long-term viability and success of the system.\nExploring the potential of FairFlow in cross-chain applications also presents an exciting opportunity. Adapting FairFlow to function across different blockchain platforms could significantly expand its impact and utility within the decentralized ecosystem. This exploration would contribute to the broader application and influence of FairFlow in various blockchain contexts.\nLastly, a user-centric design approach is paramount. With the added complexity introduced by FairFlow, it is essential to ensure that the user experience remains intuitive and accessible. Future work should prioritize user-friendliness and accessibility, making FairFlow a practical and convenient solution for users within the Ethereum network and potentially beyond. This focus on user-centric design is crucial for achieving widespread adoption and usability of FairFlow.\nThis paper introduced FairFlow, a novel protocol designed to enhance transaction privacy and fairness while mitigating Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in the Ethereum ecosystem. FairFlow\u2019s unique approach, integrating Auction Managers, Order Guardians, and Privacy Keepers into Ethereum\u2019s transaction processing, marks a significant step forward in addressing some of the most pressing challenges in blockchain technology. By implementing a transparent auction mechanism and employing advanced cryptographic methods, FairFlow aims to democratize transaction processing, reduce MEV opportunities, and protect user privacy.\nFairFlow represents a meaningful contribution to ongoing efforts to make blockchain technology more secure, private, and fair. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of the protocol to the Ethereum community and the broader blockchain landscape are significant. As the field continues to evolve, FairFlow stands as a testament to the innovative spirit driving the blockchain community forward, continually seeking solutions that improve the efficacy, security, and fairness of decentralized networks.\nSource 3:\nLast edit:@wackerow(opens in a new tab),February 12, 2025\nMaximal extractable value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block.\nMaximal extractable value was first applied in the context ofproof-of-work, and initially referred to as \"miner extractable value\". This is because in proof-of-work, miners control transaction inclusion, exclusion, and ordering. However, since the transition to proof-of-stake viaThe Mergevalidators have been responsible for these roles, and mining is no longer part of the Ethereum protocol. The value extraction methods still exist, though, so the term \"Maximal extractable value\" is now used instead.\nMake sure you're familiar withtransactions,blocks,proof-of-stakeandgas. Familiarity withdappsandDeFiis helpful as well.\nIn theory MEV accrues entirely to validators because they are the only party that can guarantee the execution of a profitable MEV opportunity. In practice, however, a large portion of MEV is extracted by independent network participants referred to as \"searchers.\" Searchers run complex algorithms on blockchain data to detect profitable MEV opportunities and have bots to automatically submit those profitable transactions to the network.\nValidators do get a portion of the full MEV amount anyway because searchers are willing to pay high gas fees (which go to the validator) in exchange for higher likelihood of inclusion of their profitable transactions in a block. Assuming searchers are economically rational, the gas fee that a searcher is willing to pay will be an amount up to 100% of the searcher's MEV (because if the gas fee was higher, the searcher would lose money).\nWith that, for some highly competitive MEV opportunities, such asDEX arbitrage, searchers may have to pay 90% or even more of their total MEV revenue in gas fees to the validator because so many people want to run the same profitable arbitrage trade. This is because the only way to guarantee that their arbitrage transaction runs is if they submit the transaction with the highest gas price.\nThis dynamic has made being good at \"gas golfing\" \u2014 programming transactions so that they use the least amount of gas \u2014 a competitive advantage, because it allows searchers to set a higher gas price while keeping their total gas fees constant (since gas fees = gas price*gas used).\nSearchers look for lucrative MEV opportunities and send transaction bundles to block proposers along with asealed-price bid(opens in a new tab)for inclusion in the block. The validator running mev-geth, a forked version of the go-ethereum (Geth) client only has to choose the bundle with the most profit and include it as part of the new block. To protect block proposers (validators) from spam and invalid transactions, transaction bundles pass throughrelayersfor validation before getting to the proposer.\nMEV Boost retains the same workings of the original Flashbots auction, albeit with new features designed for Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake. Searchers still find profitable MEV transactions for inclusion in blocks, but a new class of specialized parties, calledbuilders, are responsible for aggregating transactions and bundles into blocks. A builder accepts sealed-price bids from searchers and runs optimizations to find the most profitable ordering.\nThe relayer is still responsible for validating transaction bundles before passing them to the proposer. However, MEV Boost introducesescrowsresponsible for providingdata availabilityby storing block bodies sent by builders and block headers sent by validators. Here, a validator connected to a relay asks for available execution payloads and uses MEV Boost\u2019s ordering algorithm to select the payload header with the highest bid + MEV tips.\nThe core benefit of the Builder API is its potential to democratize access to MEV opportunities. Using commit-reveal schemes eliminates trust assumptions and reduces entry barriers for validators seeking to benefit from MEV. This should reduce the pressure on solo stakers to integrate with large staking pools in order to boost MEV profits.\nWidespread implementation of the Builder API will encourage greater competition among block builders, which increases censorship resistance. As validators review bids from multiple builders, a builder intent on censoring one or more user transactions must outbid all other non-censoring builders to be successful. This dramatically increases the cost of censoring users and discourages the practice.\nSome projects, such as MEV Boost, use the Builder API as part of an overall structure designed to provide transaction privacy to certain parties, such as traders trying to avoid frontrunning/sandwiching attacks. This is achieved by providing a private communication channel between users and block builders. Unlike the permissioned mempools described earlier, this approach is beneficial for the following reasons:\nThe existence of multiple builders on the market makes censoring impractical, which benefits users. In contrast, the existence of centralized and trust-based dark pools would concentrate power in the hands of a few block builders and increase the possibility of censoring.\nThe Builder API software is open-source, which allows anyone to offer block-builder services. This means users aren\u2019t forced into using any particular block builder and improves Ethereum\u2019s neutrality and permissionlessness. Moreover, MEV-seeking traders won\u2019t inadvertently contribute to centralization by using private transaction channels.\nSource 4:\nMaximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the maximum amount of value a blockchain miner or validator can make by including, excluding, or changing the order of transactions during the block production process.\nThe blockchain economy has experienced a period of exponential growth in the last few years, with the value locked in theDeFiecosystem reaching $300B at its peak in 2022. However, with the growing adoption of smart contracts come new loopholes through which value can be siphoned away from unwitting users.

Simply put, block producers can determine the order in which transactions are processed on the blockchain and exploit that power to their advantage.\nMEV is increasingly referred to asmaximal extractable valueinstead of the original term miner extractable value. This is due to MEV not being limited to just miners in proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains, but also applying to validators in proof-of-stake (PoS) and other types of networks as well. To encompass the full scope of MEV across the multi-chain ecosystem, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll refer to the former terminology in this blog post.\nIn the 2019 research paper entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlash Boys 2.0,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the authors of which include Chainlink Labs researchers Ari Juels and Lorenz Breidenbach, MEV and transaction reordering are not just explained as a theoretical concept, but as a dynamic that is already occurring at scale in the form of transaction frontrunning on decentralized exchanges and which can have a significant impact on the user experience. By the start of 2021, thecumulative value of MEV extractedon Ethereum reached $78m, which then shot up to $554m by the end of the year.

For instance, in tactical surveillance of battlefields, scalability and sustainability are indispensable for maintaining large-scale military multimedia applications in MMNs. Therefore, many data-driven networking solutions are leveraged to optimize streaming strategies based on real-time traffic analysis and resource monitoring. In addition, generative AI (GAI) can not only increase the efficiency of existing data-driven solutions through data augmentation but also develop potential capabilities for MMNs, including AIgenerated content (AIGC) and AI-aided perception. In this article, we propose the framework of GAI-enabled MMNs that leverage the capabilities of GAI in data and content synthesis to distribute high-quality and immersive interactive content in wireless networks. Specifically, we outline the framework of GAI-enabled MMNs and then introduce its three main features, including distribution, generation, and perception. Furthermore, we propose a second-score auction mechanism for allocating network resources by considering GAI model values and other metrics jointly. The experimental results show that the proposed auction mechanism can effectively increase social welfare by allocating resources and models with the highest user satisfaction.\n\n*Index Terms*\u2014Mobile multimedia networks, tactical surveillance, generative AI, resource allocation, auction theory\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nMobile multimedia networks (MMNs) [1] have become a critical component in 5/6G, supporting a wide range of applications such as video streaming, video conferences, tactical surveillance, and Metaverse. To make efficient utilization of limited resources in MMNs, AI is leveraged in various ways to determine the streaming configuration of MMNs, including streaming bitrates, buffering strategies, and power allocations for content distribution. Specifically, VR environments can simulate real-world battle scenarios for training. However, VR devices have limited computational capacities and battery life. Therefore, AI-based distribution solutions can extend the virtual operating time and enhance the quality of training. Moreover, generative AI (GAI) can not only synthesize training datasets for data-driven solutions but also create high-quality and naturalistic AI-generated content (AIGC) in various modalities, e.g., images, videos, and 3D content [2]. For example, GAI models can create tactical plans for different scenarios and improve user perception through interactive maps and AI-generated 3D terrain models.\n\n1\n\nFor data-driven networking solutions in MMNs, GAI can improve delivery efficiency and scalability of multimedia delivery while satisfying user experience by determining network configurations, including streaming bitrate, caching strategies, and transmit power, based on real-time traffic analysis and resource monitoring for tactical surveillance systems [1]. Due to the heterogeneity of user devices in MMNs, optimizing streaming bitrate with flexible GAI models ensures that users experience high-quality and fair multimedia content without interruptions, adapting to their computing capacity and connectivity. As the content requested by users becomes more dynamic, such as short video sharing in tactical surveillance systems [3], GAI-empowered data-driven caching strategies can both enhance user experience by reducing content loading times and decrease network traffic by minimizing real-time data transfers. Finally, adapting transmit power via GAI not only guarantees a stable and longer connection for multimedia streaming but also promotes energy efficiency.\n\nFor intelligent content generation in MMNs, GAI can develop novel content generation [4], synchronization [5], and animation [6] techniques to enrich user experiences without increasing data traffic in GAI-enabled MMNs. By leveraging computing resources, users can leverage GAI models to create, repair, and edit multimedia content [7]\u2013[9], such as generating music, producing images or video clips from brief descriptions, filling in missing frames in a video, or applying artistic styles to photo beautification directly with their mobile devices, which ensures faster content delivery but also satisfies users' expectations or context. Regarding the received content, users in tactical surveillance systems can adopt super-resolution and interpolation techniques to leverage GAI to enhance the quality of low-resolution images or videos by generating high-definition versions [10] and estimating intermediate frames in videos [11], respectively. Finally, GAI can synchronize different media types and revolutionize animation in multimedia content production, including character design, motion capture, facial animation, scenery and background generation, and interactive animation.\n\nAlthough GAI offers many advantages for various multimedia applications, there are also many remaining potential challenges to overcome to deploy GAI in MMNs. For resourceconstrained mobile devices, long processing times and high energy consumption when running GAI models can affect the quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) [12]. Additionally, collecting large amounts of data for pre-training\n\nM. Xu and D. Niyato are with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798, Singapore. J.

Finally, for GAI models used in MMNs, ensuring the stability in the scale of multimedia applications and consistency of generated content is critical to user experiences [13].\n\nIn this article, we propose a framework of Generative AIenabled MMNs to provide real-time and low-latency multimedia services to wireless users. Under this framework, GAI techniques can not only enhance the efficiency and scalability of content distribution in existing multimedia networks and tactical surveillance systems but also introduce new capabilities for dynamic content generation and perception. Additionally, to allocate network resources to execute generative modelbased multimedia services, we propose a second-score auction to optimize the efficiency of resource utilization of edge servers. Compared to the second-price auction, the proposed mechanism can achieve higher revenue improvement when the model scales increase.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] T. Fujihashi, T.

      "response_tokens": 1293,
      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to design a liquidity provisioning algorithm that optimally balances capital efficiency across multiple concentrated liquidity ranges and handles volatility regimes dynamically. Hmm, where do I start? Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, what is liquidity provisioning? From what I remember, it's about ensuring there are enough assets in the pool to cover the liquidity needs of users. It helps prevent situations where a large number of users trying to withdraw their tokens without sufficient funds cause a price drop and market crashes. So, the algorithm should manage this balance.\n\nThe key points mentioned are optimizing capital efficiency across multiple ranges and dynamically adjusting to volatility regimes. Volatility regimes refer to periods when the market is very stable (low volatility) versus very volatile. So, the algorithm needs to handle both scenarios smoothly without causing stress during one period but efficiently in another.\n\nI think I need to consider several factors here. The first is liquidity pool size adjustment. Maybe the number of users or tokens in a liquidity pool affects how much liquidity needs to be provisioned. More users could mean more potential liquidity loss, so perhaps adjusting pools dynamically based on current conditions is important.\n\nNext, the algorithm must handle multiple concentrated liquidity ranges. These might include different pools with varying characteristics\u2014like some high-precision and others more broadly. Balancing these sounds like it requires some form of optimization or dynamic adjustment of allocation across them to maximize efficiency while managing risk.\n\nDynamic response to volatility regimes suggests that the system should be able to adapt quickly when conditions change, whether from a period of low to high volatility. This might involve predictive models or real-time adjustments based on market data.\n\nI recall something about risk management in liquid assets. Maybe using statistical models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) would help capture different volatility states by mixing multiple distributions. That way, the system can switch between handling low-volatility events and high-volatility scenarios seamlessly.\n\nAnother thought is about diversification across pools. If there are multiple pools with similar characteristics, the algorithm might need to diversify the allocation\u2014some in high-precision pools and others in broader ones\u2014to reduce risk without overprovisioning one place where stress could occur.\n\nOptimizing capital efficiency probably involves mathematical models that balance return on liquidity used against the cost of provision. Maybe something like maximizing net position size or minimizing the variance in the pool's value, ensuring that each portion is used efficiently without unnecessary costs.\n\nI also think about how to model volatility regimes. If the market enters a new regime (like after a significant event), the algorithm should be able to switch quickly and apply appropriate liquidity provision strategies. This might involve switching models based on some form of state or condition related to volatility metrics.\n\nPerhaps using an approach where the system is in one model when conditions are stable and switches to another when volatility increases could work. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of that mechanism.\n\nI should also consider computational efficiency, given that liquid assets can be numerous. Maybe a heuristic or an approximate method that doesn't require massive computation but still provides near-optimal results is better than something too complex for real-time use.\n\nTesting this algorithm under different volatility regimes and user behavior changes is crucial. It's not just about theoretical models; it needs to work in practice, ensuring stability during low-volatility times and resilience against market swings during high-volatility periods.\n\nI wonder if there are existing algorithms or frameworks that handle similar issues. Maybe something like risk management systems used in finance that use GMMs for volatility modeling. If so, integrating those concepts into the algorithm could be beneficial.\n\nAlso, considering transaction costs and market impact when provisioning liquidity is important too. The system should not only manage capital but also minimize the impact on users' accounts or the overall market price.\n\nI'm a bit fuzzy on how exactly to implement this. Let me outline steps:\n\n1. **Market Data Collection**: Gather current volatility metrics, historical data, user balances, and other relevant information.\n\n2. **Volatility Regime Detection**: Use statistical methods like GMMs to detect when the system is entering a high-volatility regime. Maybe look at parameters such as mean reversion speed or standard deviation changes over time.\n\n3. **Algorithm Model**: Develop mathematical models that capture how liquidity pools should be sized, adjusted based on current volatility and user behavior.\n\n4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Implement rules or algorithms within the model to dynamically adjust pool sizes, allocation across pools, or even the provision of new liquidity tokens as needed.\n\n5. **Testing and Validation**: Test the algorithm under various scenarios\u2014low volatility, high volatility, sudden changes in user balances, etc.\u2014to ensure it works as intended.\n\n6. **Implementation and Monitoring**: Put the model into action, considering computational efficiency, and continuously monitor performance to adjust as necessary.\n\nI think I've covered the main points, but I might be missing some specifics or oversimplifying certain aspects. Maybe I should look into more details on how exactly each of these steps is handled in practice, including any potential challenges like transaction costs or user decision-making impacts.\n</think>\n\nDesigning a liquidity provisioning algorithm that optimally balances capital efficiency across multiple pools and handles volatility regimes involves several key components:\n\n1. **Market Data Collection**: Gather current volatility metrics, historical data, user balances, and other relevant information to inform the system.\n\n2. **Volatility Regime Detection**: Use statistical methods like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to detect when the system is entering a high-volatility regime by analyzing parameters such as mean reversion speed or standard deviation changes over time.\n\n3. **Algorithm Model**: Develop mathematical models that capture how liquidity pools should be sized, adjusted based on current volatility and user behavior. This may involve dynamic optimization of net position size to balance return on liquidity used against provision costs.\n\n4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Implement rules or algorithms within the model to dynamically adjust pool sizes, allocation across pools, or new liquidity provisioning as needed during volatile or stable periods.\n\n5. **Testing and Validation**: Test the algorithm under various scenarios\u2014low volatility, high volatility, sudden changes in user balances, etc.\u2014to ensure it works as intended.\n\n6. **Implementation and Monitoring**: Put the model into action, considering computational efficiency, and continuously monitor performance to adjust as necessary.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the liquidity system dynamically adapts to market conditions, optimizing capital efficiency while managing risks effectively."

I'm new to this topic, so I'll have to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Uniswap is a decentralized exchange, but the original version was called Uniswap V1 or something like that. The user mentioned they moved on to V3, which introduced concentrated liquidity and multiple fee tiers. So, the paper should probably discuss how these features have changed things for LPs compared to before.\n\nI remember from the previous section that LVR is a metric used by LVR authors to measure the cost of adverse selection in LPs. Adverse selection happens when there are not enough informed arbitrageurs, so LPs pay more because they're at a disadvantage. But it only looks at the starting and ending prices, ignoring what happens during trading.\n\nLVR's limitation is that it requires an expiration time T, which makes it an approximation rather than precise. Also, their model uses perpetual options as either puts or calls, but in reality, LPs can have varying positions, not just fixed ones.\n\nLooking at the references, Lambert focused on pricing models in the Black-Scholes framework using perpetual options. He extended this to include stochastic processes and tried to replicate liquidity positions with covered calls. But his model needed a specific time frame T, which isn't always applicable because market conditions change dynamically.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the introduction should:\n\n1.

This paper explores the role of LVR, a risk assessment tool designed to evaluate LPs' costs due to adverse selection. While useful for assessing risks, LVR's reliance on an expiration time T makes it an approximation rather than a precise model.\n\nLambert's work extended pricing models using perpetual options in the Black-Scholes framework, though his approach required this fixed T, which isn't always applicable. His model used perpetual puts and calls but didn't account for real-world factors like changing volatility or multiple fee tiers. The research aims to build a more dynamic pricing model using stochastic processes, addressing these limitations by allowing for varying market conditions without assuming an expiration time. This framework will provide a more accurate evaluation of LPs in V3, contributing to future liquidity provision strategies.",
      "context": "Source 1:\nThis paper applies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize liquidity provisioning in Uniswap v3, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol implementing an automated market maker (AMM) model with concentrated liquidity. We model the liquidity provision task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train an active liquidity provider (LP) agent using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The agent dynamically adjusts liquidity positions by using information about price dynamics to balance fee maximization and impermanent loss mitigation. We use a rolling window approach for training and testing, reflecting realistic market conditions and regime shifts. This study compares the data-driven performance of the DRL-based strategy against common heuristics adopted by small retail LP actors that do not systematically modify their liquidity positions. By promoting more efficient liquidity management, this work aims to make DeFi markets more accessible and inclusive for a broader range of participants. Through a data-driven approach to liquidity management, this work seeks to contribute to the ongoing development of more efficient and user-friendly DeFi markets.\nThe emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi)111DeFi refers to a set of blockchain-based protocols that enable financial activities such as asset exchange, lending, and borrowing without intermediaries, leveraging smart contracts to facilitate transactions transparently and securely.(Zetzsche, Arner, and Buckley2020; Auer et al.2024)has led to new mechanisms for cryptocurrency exchange that diverge significantly from the traditional limit order book (LOB) models used by centralized exchanges for conventional assets. Within DeFi, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap v3 implement Automated Market Maker (AMM) mechanisms, where programmable softwares, known as smart contracts, govern both liquidity provisioning and the pricing of token pairs. In contrast to the centralized LOB model, where market makers actively provide liquidity by placing bid and ask orders across a range of prices, DEXs depend on liquidity providers (LPs) who lock assets within liquidity pools(Milionis, Moallemi, and Roughgarden2023). Trading fees compensate LPs for their commitment, positioning them as central actors in the DeFi ecosystem. While some AMMs, such as dYdX(Juliano2018), incorporate a blockchain-based LOB structure, the majority, including Uniswap, rely on liquidity pools governed by algorithmic pricing mechanisms. Nevertheless, the lack of a traditional LOB in AMMs imposes unique challenges on LPs, who lock their tokens in a given pool, enabling liquidity takers, or swappers, to trade against these assets. This activity shifts prices from the level at the time of liquidity provision, exposing LPs to market volatility and costs that harm profitability.\nUniswap v3(Adams et al.2021), an AMM with a constant function market maker (CFMM), introduced the concept of concentrated liquidity(Fritsch2021), enabling LPs to provide liquidity within specified price ranges rather than across the entire price spectrum. While this feature improves capital efficiency, it also introduces a risk: impermanent loss (IL) can occur not only when the price diverges from its initial value at the inception of the LP position, as observed in earlier versions like Uniswap v2, but also when the market price of the asset pair deviates outside the selected boundaries, rendering the LP\u2019s position inactive and ceasing fee earnings. Concentrated liquidity intensifies losses from price deviations outside the chosen range by removing the offsetting benefit of trading fees. For these reasons, liquidity provision in Uniswap v3 often proves unprofitable, especially for retail traders(Loesch et al.2021).\nA key factor behind this challenge is the frequent arbitrage that occurs between centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) due to the inherent design of AMMs(Wang et al.2022). In contrast to the continuous price updates in centralized limit order books, AMMs like Uniswap v3 adjust prices based on the liquidity pool\u2019s token ratio, which can create price staleness when market prices shift rapidly in CEXs and trading is not happening at the same pace on DEXs. This staleness arises because, in the absence of swaps initiated by liquidity takers, the price on blockchain-based AMMs remains static. Since the blockchain lacks knowledge of external market dynamics, it cannot automatically adjust the price according to the price discovery mechanisms occurring off-chain on centralized exchanges. The price staleness exposes LPs to adverse selection costs, particularly through a mechanism called Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR)(Milionis et al.2023). LVR, similar to the concept of \u201dpicked-off risk\u201d in traditional finance, captures losses incurred when arbitrageurs exploit outdated AMM prices to generate riskless profits by aligning the AMM price with the broader market off-chain. For LPs, especially those using passive, range-bound strategies, this results in realized losses when asset prices deviate from their initial values because they need to modify the price boundaries to ensure they can earn trading fees. The issue is further compounded by the high volatility typical of cryptocurrency markets, which drives LP positions out of profitable ranges, often requiring these costly rebalancing. These factors collectively make liquidity provision a high-risk activity where the fees earned are frequently insufficient to offset losses, posing significant challenges, particularly for smaller and passive LPs that do not modify their liquidity position after deployment.\nManaging liquidity provisioning within this AMM framework can be conceptualized as a discrete-time control problem: LPs must decide at each time step whether to retain their current price range at which they deployed their liquidity position on the blockchain or to withdraw and redeploy liquidity at a new range, possibly centered around the current price offered by the AMM. LPs must trade off rebalancing frequency against the potential fees they collect by specifying a narrow price range around the current price. Frequent rebalancing can prevent inactive positions and maintain fee generation, but it incurs gas fee expenses due to withdrawal and redeployment on a blockchain platform and may realize significant losses if the current market price diverges significantly from the LP\u2019s initial position. Additionally, arbitrage opportunities created by price discrepancies between CEXs and DEXs further impact LP profits by contributing to price slippage, amplifying the complexity of liquidity management.\nOptimizing liquidity provisioning within AMMs has implications that extend beyond individual profitability, enhancing the overall value and stability of DeFi systems. Developing more efficient mechanisms for liquidity provision can attract a broader range of participants, including less sophisticated retail traders, by making LP activities more accessible and lowering the barriers posed by high gas fees and frequent arbitrage. DeFi systems foster financial inclusion as they become more active and robust, particularly in regions where traditional banking and financial services remain inefficient or inaccessible(Ali, Shahzad, and Chaudhary2024). Ultimately, improving the efficiency of liquidity provision from the LP perspective ensures the sustained growth of the DeFi ecosystem and positions it as a viable and innovative alternative to traditional finance.\nThe problem of liquidity provisioning naturally unfolds as a sequential decision-making process, where LPs must balance the trade-off between risk and return over time. Reinforcement learning (RL), as a data-driven optimal control framework, is well-suited for addressing such challenges. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to optimize liquidity provisioning in Uniswap v3, enabling an LP to act as an agent that systematically rebalances its position over time. By modeling LP decision-making through an RL framework, we seek to maximize fees while minimizing losses. Thedeepaspect of DRL leverages neural networks as approximators for value and policy functions, enabling the agent to handle the complexities of liquidity management in dynamic market environments. From this section onward, we refer to RL as the stochastic control problem to be addressed, while DRL denotes the specific algorithmic framework employed to solve it. The active LP agent dynamically adapts its actions based on price movements, balancing the dual objectives of fee maximization and loss mitigation. This approach allows for a data-driven exploration of LPs\u2019 optimal rebalancing frequency and positioning strategy, potentially addressing longstanding inefficiencies in passive liquidity provision.\nUniswap v3 tailors liquidity provision to a specific price range[ptl,ptu]superscriptsubscript\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc59superscriptsubscript\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc62[p_{t}^{l},p_{t}^{u}][ italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_u end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ], fundamentally altering the constant product formula from Uniswap v2.

In this paper, we characterise the continuous-time wealth dynamics of strategic LPs who dynamically adjust their range of liquidity provision in CL pools. Their wealth results from fee income, the value of their holdings in the pool, and rebalancing costs. Next, we derive a self-financing and closed-form optimal liquidity provision strategy where the width of the LP's liquidity range is determined by the profitability of the pool (provision fees minus gas fees), the predictable losses (PL) of the LP's position, and concentration risk. Concentration risk refers to the decrease in fee revenue if the marginal exchange rate (akin to the midprice in a limit order book) in the pool exits the LP's range of liquidity. When the drift in the marginal rate is stochastic, we show how to optimally skew the range of liquidity to increase fee revenue and profit from the expected changes in the marginal rate. Finally, we use Uniswap v3 data to show that, on average, LPs have traded at a significant loss, and to show that the out-of-sample performance of our strategy is superior to the historical performance of LPs in the pool we consider.\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?Learn more about arXivLabs.\narXiv Operational StatusGet status notifications viaemailorslack\nSource 3:\n## 2 Background\n\nSolution method via convex optimization. Problem (4) is a convex optimization problem [BV04] because the objective is concave maximization and the constraint set is a (scaled) probability simplex. Using the identity \u2212x/(x+b) = b/(x + b) \u2212 1, Problem (4) is equivalent to\n\nminimize \n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{a_{i}b_{i}}{x_{i}+b_{i}}-c_{i}x_{i}-a_{i}\\right)$$\n (5) subject to \n$$-x\\preceq0,\\qquad\\mathbf{1}^{T}x=d,$$\n\nwhich is the standard form of a convex problem.\n\nTherefore a global solution can be certified to a given level of accuracy. Also, software tools and computational solvers are widely available and relatively easy to use in practice. It is possible for liquidity providers to iterate quickly using this approach under changing market conditions.\n\nFigure (2) walks through the steps of solving Problem (4) using cvxpy [DB16], a Python embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems. The software performs best when parameters a, b, c, and d are scaled to have values near 1, rather than, say, values near 1 million. We offer tips and approaches for estimating these parameters from historical data and market intelligence in Section 4.\n\n### 4 Parameter Estimation\n\nCurrent liquidity by tick, b, is known. The amount of liquidity provisioned to the current tick usually appears as a state of the AMM.\n\nAdditional processing may be required to transform net liquidity changes from neighboring ticks into an absolute value, but the result is typically easy to verify using online tools such as 'info.uniswap.org' for Uniswap V3 ticks.\n\nUse swap volume to predict a, future fees by tick. As evident from the water-filling solution to Problem (1), swap volume, as well as price volatility, plays a significant role in the optimal provision. There are two important aspects to swap volume: shape and size.\n\nOne approach to swap volume estimation uses signals processing techniques for non-parametric fitting. For example, denoise a (centered) Rn-valued signal over T time periods in order to uncover a latent (possibly dynamic) market signal, whose noisy estimates are observed at every time period.\n\nAnother approach is to fit statistical models, either jointly over shape and size, or separately. For example, fit a Gaussian shape to centered and scaled tick-wise swap volumes taken from a range of time periods. Then scale by total swap volume averaged over multiple time periods.\n\nOne may incorporate market intelligence into estimates. If an upcoming event is expected to drive higher trade volume (not only higher volatility), then estimates derived from historical data may be manually adjusted to reflect the anticipation.\n\nThere is a particular type of data processing step that is frequently needed for proper calculation of historical swap volume by tick. Swaps that start in\n\n```\nimport cvxpy as cp\n\n# specify parameters and variables\n\na = cp.Parameter(n, pos=True)\nb = cp.Parameter(n, pos=True)\nc = cp.Parameter(n, pos=True)\nd = cp.Parameter(pos=True)\nx = cp.Variable(n, pos=True)\n\n# set parameter values\n\na.value = fee_by_tick\nb.value = liquidity_by_tick\nc.value = reserves_return_by_tick\nd.value = total_capital\n\n# construct the convex optimization problem\n\nobj = cp.Minimize(\n    cp.multiply(a, b)@cp.inv_pos(x+b)\n    - c@x - cp.sum(a)\n)\nconstraints = [cp.sum(x) == d, x >= 0]\nprob = cp.Problem(obj, constraints)\n\n# solve\n\nbest_return = prob.solve()\nbest_provision = x.value\n```\nFigure 2: A code snippet from a solution to the maximum return provisioning problem implemented using the cvxpy software package.\n\ntick i and end in tick j generate swap volume that appears in tick i, tick j, and all ticks in between. It is possible to determine exactly how much volume is swapped by each tick using details about the AMM, such pre- and post-swap price, as well as liquidity for every tick along the price path.\n\nThe final step is to scale tick-wise swap volume by the tick's fee tier, which is known. Fee tiers are usually 1, 5, 30, or 100 basis points, passing that fraction of total swap volume on to providers as fees earned for their service.\n\nWe may consider candidate ticks from pools with different fee tiers, e.g., ticks associated with ETH-USDC swaps for pools with 0.05% and 0.3% fee tiers. For each fee tier, swap volume by tick will be different, and of course the fee multiplier will be different.\n\nUse price volatility to predict c, expected return of reserves by tick. For any tick, its return of reserves, ri \u2208 Rn +, is a deterministic function of asset price and invariant under time and price path. Consider the two examples of\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_6_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\n</F>\n\nUniswap V3 ticks illustrated in Figure (3), which are displayed on a log scale for clarity.\n\nFigure 3: Log return of reserves for two ticks from a Uniswap V3 pool. One tick is active at a higher price ( ) while the other is active at a lower price ( ).\n\nReserves provisioned to a \"higher\" tick start out as only asset, and increase in value while the price rises until the tick is in range and asset is swapped for stable. Meanwhile reserves provisioned to a \"lower\" tick start out as only stable, and maintain constant value while the price drops until the tick is in range and stable is swapped for asset. For both, asset value shrinks as price drops, and hits a ceiling as price rises.\n\nNotice that the expected return, ci , for tick i depends on next period price, which is a random variable with mass function p \u2208 Rn +. So\n\n$$c_{i}=p^{T}r_{i},\\qquad i=1,\\ldots,n.\\tag{6}$$\n\nAnd so the sum Pn i=1 ci = p T ( Pn i=1 ri) is expected value of a portfolio after one time period if each tick is provisioned one unit of capital (e.g., $1).\n\nBy definition, volatility is the standard deviation of p, the next-period price, multiplied by the square root of the number of time periods in, say, a year. A common model for price is geometric Brownian motion, i.e., one assumes log price returns are iid Gaussian so that the model is straight forward to fit using historical data.\n\nFinally, it is possible to consider a candidate pool of ticks from protocols with different swap criteria (e.g., constant product- and constant sum- market makers) because ri may be tailored separately for each tick i.\n\nModels for volatility and volume should be consistent. It's possible for swap volume by tick to have a different shape than the distribution of prices after one period. This may be due to a number of factors, such mid-period events, concentrated liquidity, order book depth, and more.\n\nYet there are some swap volume curves (e.g., low entropy concentrated volume) that are inconsistent with price change curves (e.g., high entropy price dispersion) even under highly manipulative conditions. Or swap volume may be centered around a price that's different from the center of future prices. Solutions to Problem (4) where parameters a and c are generated from inconsistent volatility and volume models may look strange, even though the objective is properly optimized.\n\n### 5 Experiments\nSource 4:\n# solve\n\nWe begin with a qualitative test for the purpose of exploration. Consider the setting where d capital may be allocated across ticks from a candidate set, \u03a9. The current price is p and the provisions will be held for a time period of T days. To estimate a, determine the standard deviation of swap volume data from the previous T days, and center a Gaussian with that standard deviation at the current price. To estimate c, use implied volatility, \u03b7, to generate of distribution of where prices will be after T days.\n\nIn our experiment, d is $1 million, T is 7 days, and \u03a9 is the set of ticks for the ETH-USDC pair with 0.05% fee from Uniswap V3 on Ethereum. The price p was $2780 on February 16, 2024, and so ticks were limited further still to the range of $2500 to $3060, or \u00b110% of the current price. We choose implied volatility \u03b7 = 80% because it appears to be roughly the 7-day moving average of implied volatility estimates from options data across various trading platforms. We used the 'web3.py' software package to pull liquidity, price, and swap volume data directly from the Uniswap V3 protocol.\n\nFigure (4) illustrates liquidity, b, already in the pool as well as provisions, x, in green. First, notice that there are no provisions at the current tick. Rather, almost all liquidity is provisioned to ticks in the $2830 to $2980 price range. One reason for this is there is a drop off in liquidity at that range, implying a larger portion of fees for the same amount of capital. Second, we notice that the amount provisioned to each tick tapers off as the price gets larger. Presumably the rate of tapering depends on the trade-off between price volume and volatility.\n\nWe consider these two effects in Figure (5). On the left, previous swap volume is shown in yellow. Even though the yellow historical data not appear Gaussian in shape, the purple distribution centered at the current price is our estimate of future volume, which is proportional to a. To the right is the expected return on reserves, c, under the assumption that asset prices following geometric Brownian motion with implied volatility determined by the market. Notice that the greatest loss occurs at the current price. Among ticks with the most at stake (i.e., ticks at, or above, current price) it also has the least to gain.\n\nNow consider the setting where we may choose how much total capital, d, to provision. Figure (6) illustrates the shape that tick-by-tick provisions follow as more capital is allocated to the pools. The top row illustrates the overlay of new provisions to current liquidity, and the bottom row shows only the tickby-tick provisions as determined by Problem (4). From the top, it's clear that\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_8_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFigure 4: Given current liquidity, the optimal tick-by-tick provision is concentrated in the well closest to the current asset price.\n</F>\n\nprovisions continue to seek a larger portion of fees by piling more quickly into wells. We call this the 'fee-chasing' effect. We also notice a bi-modal shape emerging as d increases. We say this is due to the reserves 'loss-avoiding' effect, which scales linearly in d and thus becomes more prominent at large values. To our knowledge, this phenomena is new to the community of liquidity providers.\n\nFinally, we wish to understand how the performance of tick-by-tick provisioning compares to that of single-range provisioning, where provision are equally distributed across ticks and centered around the current price. For good measure, we consider the delta-neutral version as well, where a short position equal to the value of reserves across all assets in ticks is opened to remove asset exposure at the current price.\n\nConsider the setting where the tick-by-tick model is fit to data from the previous S days. Then market behavior is simulated for T days before the positions are closed. The new value of reserves and earned fees determines performance. This process is repeated every R days.\n\nTable (5) shows the results of this experiment for a single range tick spanning ticks at \u00b110% of the current price, where T = S = 7 days and R = 4 days. (We\n\n# solve\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_9_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFigure 5: On the left, historical swap volume (yellow) and predicted swap volume (purple) share the same standard deviation and total size but take different shapes.

This experiment roughly covers data from January 1, 2024 \u2013 February 16, 2024, and corresponds to a period of roughly 30% growth in the price of ETH.\n\nThe results show that, for this set of market conditions, tick-by-tick provisioning performed better in expectation but performance fluctuated more each week. The single range strategy benefited from upside exposure in the underlying asset, which hurt the performance of the delta-neutral approach. The authors conclude that further testing is needed to compare the performance un-\n\n<T>\n| Train block | Test block | Tick by tick | Range \u00b110% | Delta-neutral |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 18943206 | 18993312 | 4.24% | 4.50% | 0.49% |\n| 18971817 | 19021923 | 4.00% | 4.48% | -1.11% |\n| 19000435 | 19050541 | 1.69% | 3.86% | -2.57% |\n| 19029031 | 19079137 | 10.63% | 5.25% | -8.56% |\n| 19057636 | 19107742 | 8.67% | 5.30% | -6.25% |\n| 19086319 | 19136425 | 7.38% | 4.96% | -6.66% |\n| 19114856 | 19164962 | 3.55% | 4.79% | -5.97% |\n| 19143467 | 19193573 | 1.1% | 3.80% | -3.71% |\n|  | mean | 5.16% | 4.62% | -4.29% |\n|  | std | 3.17% | 0.54% | 2.89% |\n</T>\n\nder different market conditions.

There are competing effects that are unique to liquidity providers, and we use vector and convex math, rather than financial greeks (e.g., delta, theta, gamma), to strike this balance without leaving money on the table. We also separate out the effects due to price volume from those due to volatility. In our experience, these two effects are often conflated.\n\nThere remain many open questions and the need for further results in order to determine how best to utilize the framework. To name just a few,\n\n- What does a multi-pool tick provision look like? In what capacity are multi-fee provisions optimal and are there any fee tiers missing?\n- How sensitive are the provision results to changes in estimate of volatility and volume? What more can we say about the empirical relationship between volatility and volume?\n- How does just-in-time liquidity (JIT) fit in? Rather than initialize a far away tick now, can we provision the liquidity when the price moves closer? How close? If everyone's doing this, what does it mean for our current liquidity parameter, b?\n- Is this approach delta neutral? If we look at the change in return with respect to the change in price, what shape does it take?\n- How else can we interpret the avoidance around current price? Is there a connection to LVR [Mil+23]?\n- What else can we do when Uniswap V4 is released?\n\nMost of all, we're excited by the prospect of the wider implications of these ideas. Could it be possible that optimal provisioning is not actually centered around the current price? If so, what would that mean for the community? Could this drive deeper liquidity to decentralized markets?\n\n### A Appendix\n\n#### A.1 Water filling method for maximum revenue solution\n\n(The following proof is a direct extension of an example given in [BV04] on page 245, and so the wording may be similar.)\nSource 5:\nHelp | Advanced Search \u00b7 arXiv is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for nearly 2.4 million scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and ...\nSource 6:\n# 5 Evaluation\n\n<T>\n| Demand Curve |  | Supply Curve |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Token | DAI USDC WETH | Token | DAI USDC USDT |\n| Average Error 7.3% 3.5% | 4.4% | Average Error 6.4% 3.8% | 4.3% |\nTable 1: 10-Step ahead normalized error of Aave demand and supply estimates\n</T>\n\nEmpirical validation of demand and supply models: We applied our RLS-based algorithm to demand and supply data from Aave market pools, analyzing the relationship\n\nbetween interest rates and the demand and supply curves in 3-hour intervals. Specifically, we fitted the data (Jan-Jul 2023, RLS with \u03c1 = 0.8) to our demand and supply models (Equations 10 and 9) and estimated the parameters a b t , b b t , a l t , and b l t over time. To evaluate the accuracy of these parameter estimates, we predicted demand and supply for the next 10 intervals and summarized the prediction errors in Table 1. The relatively low error across the three main pools demonstrates the effectiveness of our model and methodology. Visualizations of parameter evolution are provided in the Appendix.B.1. Utilization Error We evaluated the performance of our RLS-based controller in regulat-\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_13_Figure_2.jpeg</img>\n</F>\n\n(a) Comparison of utilization between RLSbased controller and Aave's static curves\n\n(b) Impact of transition noise on average utilization error for RLS and Aave controllers\n\nFig. 2: Comparing our interest rate controller with Aave on market conditions learnt from on-chain data\n\ning utilization compared to Aave's static curves. Using demand and supply parameters estimated from Aave data, we replicated real user behavior and set interest rates with our RLS algorithm. Figure [2a] shows that our controller maintains utilization close to the target, even with changing demand and supply. We also tested robustness by simulating demand and supply curves with their parameters performing a Gaussian random walk with a specific transition noise. As shown in Figure [2b], the RLS controller consistently outperforms Aave's, even under high transition noise levels.\n\nForgetting factor and estimation error The forgetting factor governs the trade-off between adaptivity and precision; therefore, depending on the dynamics of the demand and supply parameters, different forgetting factors should be used. Figure 6 in Appendix [B.2] illustrates the mean squared error (MSE) of the parameters a b t , b b t , a l t , b l t estimated by the RLS-based algorithm. The parameters were generated using a random walk with Gaussian noise, with a frequency of change every T = 50 steps. In this scenario, the optimal forgetting factor, which minimizes the overall MSE across all parameters, is approximately \u03c1 = 0.82.\n\nControlling liquidation Figure 3 shows our risk controller adjusting the collateral factor to liquidation threshold ratio as Ethereum's volatility changes. The goal is to maintain an average liquidation rate of 1% (orange) or 0.1% (blue), with a fixed liquidation threshold of LTt = 0.9. The controller lowers the collateral factor during high volatility to prompt borrowers to add collateral and avoid liquidation.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_14_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFig. 3: ETH volatility over time, with the controller dynamically adjusting the collateral factor.

We also characterized the protocol's responsiveness to market changes and analyzed the limits of this adaptivity when facing adversarial manipulation.\n\nLimitations and future work Our model has three key limitations, leaving room for future research. First, we assume that lending does not affect the collateral's price, which may not hold true for low-liquidity assets. Second, we focused on a single pair of lent and collateral assets. A more comprehensive model would adjust interest rates for a broader range of assets, considering interactions between multiple borrowed and collateralized assets, with potentially correlated price and volatility movements. Thirdly, Section 4 demonstrates the vulnerability of a fully automated adaptive approach to adversaries, calling for manual/governance guardrails while bringing automation to DeFi.\nSource 7:\nMichael Patrick Keane, born in 1961, is an American/Australian economist renowned for his work in Choice Modelling, structural modelling, simulation estimation, and panel data econometrics.

From 2006\u201310 he was Co-Director of the Centre for the Study of Choice (CenSoC) at UTS. Keane became a dual citizen of Australia in 2010.\n\nEducation and career\nKeane was born in Suffern, New York, United States, and graduated from Xavier High School in Manhattan in 1979. He received a B.S. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983, and a Ph.D. from Brown University in 1990.\n\nIn 1993, he became a tenured associate professor at the University of Minnesota, and was promoted to full professor in 1996. He subsequently held full professor positions at New York University (1998\u20132001) and Yale University (2000-2006).\n\nIn 2006, he moved to Australia to take up an Australian Federation Fellowship at the University of Technology Sydney. In 2011, he became an Australian Laureate Fellow at the University of New South Wales.\n\nKeane was elected a Fellow of the Econometric Society (2005), to the Council of the Econometric Society (2009), and a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia (2012). He was the recipient of the John D.C. Little award for the Best Paper in Marketing (1996) and the Kenneth J. Arrow Award for Best Paper in Health Economics (2008). In 2004\u201305, Keane was the Goldwater Chair of American Institutions at Arizona State University and, subsequently, has been a regular visiting professor there.\n\nContributions\nKeane's work is notable for the fact that it spans a very wide range of substantive and methodological areas. He is best known for work on the following topics:\n\nDiscrete choice models\nKeane's work on recursive importance sampling (the \"GHK\" algorithm), contained in his thesis (1990) and published in 1993\u20131994, made it feasible to estimate a much larger class of discrete choice models than was previously possible. In particular, his thesis developed a fast algorithm for the highly accurate calculation of areas of polyhedrons in very-high-dimensional spaces. While primarily a result in applied mathematics, this result is very useful in economics (and other social sciences) because the choice probabilities in discrete choice models generally have this form. The GHK algorithm is now included in many popular econometrics software packages, including SAS, Stata, GAUSSX, Matlab and R-Cran-Bayesm, and is a standard topic in graduate econometrics texts.\n\nConsumer demand and marketing\nA 1996 paper with Tulin Erdem in Marketing Science presented what is now the main economic model of advertising and consumer learning. This paper received the John D.C. Little Award for the Best Paper in Marketing in 1996, and it has had a major impact on the fields of marketing and industrial organization. There is now a large literature on consumer learning based on the Erdem-Keane framework. Erdem and Keane (among others) have argued that their framework can provide an economic explanation for the phenomenon known as brand equity, based on incomplete information and risk aversion. The November 2013 issue of Marketing Science contains an extensive review of the large literature based on the Erdem-Keane framework.\n\nDynamic life-cycle models\nIn a series of joint papers with Kenneth Wolpin, published between 1994 and 2010, Keane developed a major line of research on dynamic life-cycle models of career (i.e., school and work) choices. This line of research is notable both for the methodological contributions on how to estimate these types of models, and for its substantive economic contributions. Methodologically, their method of approximating the solution to computationally intensive dynamic programming problems led to a great expansion in the class of such models that are feasible to implement empirically (i.e., their method made it possible to estimate models with many more choices and state variables than was possible previously). Substantively, their seminal 1997 paper on \"The Career Decisions on Young Men\" presented the so-called \"90 percent result\"\u2014i.e., that most of what matters for lifetime earnings has already happened by age 16. This result helped to shift the focus of the human capital literature away from college education and towards early childhood education. This is now a very active area of research in economics, which has been pursued by both Keane and Wolpin and, quite notably, by the Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist James Heckman, among others.\n\nWelfare and transfer programs\nHis 1998 paper with Robert Moffitt, entitled \"Multiple welfare program participation and labor supply,\" has had great influence on subsequent models of transfer/welfare programs. This was the first paper to account for the very complex budget constraints created when people may participate in several government welfare programs simultaneously. The model predicted that welfare caseloads would drop substantially in response to earnings subsidies (like the Earned Income Tax Credit).\n\nHuman capital and labor supply\n\nIn recent years, Keane has argued persuasively that, due to human capital effects, labor supply elasticities are much larger than the previous consensus of the economics profession would suggest. These views are presented in Imai and Keane (2004), Keane (2010) and Keane and Rogerson (2012).  If correct, his views imply that welfare losses from income taxation are much higher than was previously thought. Recently, Keane gave a keynote lecture summarizing this work at the 2015 annual meeting of the Royal Economic Society. His Cowles lecture at the 2011 summer meeting of the Econometric Society also dealt with this topic.\n\nModelling expectations\nKeane's papers with David Runkle (1990, 1998) are considered fundamental contributions in the literature on how people form expectations. These papers showed that the widespread empirical failure of \"rational expectations\" was in fact due to a set of econometric and data problems (such as the failure to account for aggregate economic shocks and the effects of data revisions).\nSource 8:\n# Automated Market Makers: Toward More Profitable Liquidity Provisioning Strategies\n\nThanos Drossos\u2217 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Karlsruhe, Germany thanos.drossos@student.kit.edu\n\nNiclas Kannengie\u00dfer Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Karlsruhe, Germany niclas.kannengiesser@kit.edu\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTo trade tokens in cryptoeconomic systems, automated market makers (AMMs) typically rely on liquidity providers (LPs) that deposit tokens in exchange for rewards. To profit from such rewards, LPs must use effective liquidity provisioning strategies. However, LPs lack guidance for developing such strategies, which often leads them to financial losses. We developed a measurement model based on impermanent loss to analyze the influences of key parameters (i.e., liquidity pool type, position duration, position range size, and position size) of liquidity provisioning strategies on LPs' returns. To reveal the influences of those key parameters on LPs' profits, we used the measurement model to analyze 700 days of historical liquidity provision data of Uniswap v3. By uncovering the influences of key parameters of liquidity provisioning strategies on profitability, this work supports LPs in developing more profitable strategies.\n\n### CCS Concepts\n\n\u2022 Applied computing \u2192 Economics; \u2022 Social and professional topics \u2192 Economic impact; Socio-technical systems.\n\n#### Keywords\n\nAutomated Market Makers, Decentralized Finance, Blockchain, Impermanent Loss, Adverse Selection\n\n#### ACM Reference Format:\n\nThanos Drossos, Daniel Kirste, Niclas Kannengie\u00dfer, and Ali Sunyaev. 2025.

The AMM software code is commonly deployed to blockchain systems in the form of smart contracts. Based on mathematical functions manifested in smart contract code, AMMs set token prices and automatically execute token trades [23].\n\nTo facilitate token trading, liquidity provider (LP)\u2013based AMMs (e.g., Curve, Uniswap v3, and Sushiswap [1, 35]) rely on market participants acting as LPs by depositing tokens into designated liquidity pools [1, 24]. AMMs motivate market participants to become LPs by offering tokens as rewards in return for depositing tokens [23, 35]. Such rewards are a share of the trading fees charged by AMMs.\n\nTo increase rewards and thus profits, LPs use different strategies for managing tokens deposited in liquidity pools (referred to as positions in the following). Such strategies differ in multiple parameters, including position duration, position size, and position range size [9]. Although striving for higher rewards, LPs have mostly used strategies that resulted in very low or even no profits [15] or financial losses [28]. Such losses are mostly due to realized impermanent loss (IL), a loss in value of the liquidity position compared to holding them outside.\n\nOne reason for LPs using such unprofitable strategies is that the influences of strategies' parameters on LPs' returns (rewards and realized IL) are unclear. Consequently, LPs lack guidance on developing profitable liquidity provisioning strategies. The influences of key parameters of liquidity provisioning strategies on profitability must be better understood to guide the development of more profitable strategies. We ask the following research question: How do key parameters of liquidity provisioning strategies influence LPs' returns?\n\nUsing the concept of adverse selection costs from market microstructures [3, 6, 29], we devised a measurement model that can be used to compute the returns of LPs in constant-product AMMs with concentrated liquidity, such as Uniswap v3 [1]. The measurement model uses the metric loss-versus-holding (LVH) [2, 18\u201320] to compute IL and relate it to the fees gained by AMMs. Next, we used the measurement model to analyze historical data from nine liquidity pools on Uniswap v3 to reveal influences of key parameters of liquidity provisioning strategies on the profitability of liquidity provisioning.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Hayden Adams, Noah Zinsmeister, Moody Salem, and Daniela Robinson. 2021.

INTRODUCTION\n\nUniswap [1], launched in November 2018, represents a decentralized, open-source protocol for cryptocurrency exchange. As the first automated market maker (AMM) to achieve widespread adoption, Uniswap enables users to conduct token swaps directly from their wallets via liquidity pools. In these pools, liquidity providers (LPs) earn fees by contributing their assets.\n\nThe introduction of Uniswap V3 brought significant advancements, most notably the concept of concentrated liquidity. This feature allows LPs to allocate their capital to specific price ranges, enhancing capital efficiency and yielding higher returns while simultaneously mitigating price risk. Furthermore, Uniswap V3 incorporates multiple fee tiers, thereby providing LPs with flexibility in selecting their compensation levels in accordance with their risk tolerance.\n\nWith the ongoing expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption, the demands on LPs in Uniswap v3 have intensified. LPs are now required to meticulously balance a myriad of factors, including risk, returns, and volatility, necessitating a sophisticated understanding and strategic approach to liquidity provision.\n\n## II. RELATED WORK AND LIMITATIONS\n\n## *A. Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR)*\n\nLVR is a metric designed to quantify the impact of adverse selection on automated market maker (AMM) LPs [2]. LVR captures the costs incurred by LPs due to stale prices that better-informed arbitrageurs exploit. Unlike impermanent loss, which only considers the starting and ending points of a trade, LVR compares the performance of LPs to a rebalancing portfolio, highlighting additional costs associated with providing liquidity.\n\nLVR incorporates volatility into its calculations, making it a useful tool for selecting the optimal liquidity pool. However, it remains primarily a risk assessment tool. It does not evaluate the returns for LPs when exiting positions at different prices, nor does it provide guidance on the optimal range for marketmaking activities.\n\n## *B. Guillaume Lambert*\n\nGuillaume Lambert focused on pricing within the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) framework in his work [3] [4]. He viewed liquidity positions as perpetual options and attempted to replicate liquidity positions with covered calls. He also extends his model towards implied volatility and hedging. However, a limitation of Lambert's model is the specification of an expiration time T, which inherently makes it an approximation rather than a precise solution. Additionally, Lambert explored the use of stochastic processes to calculate the probability of prices remaining within a position range, which has greatly inspired our research. We aim to build upon this foundation by starting from stochastic processes to initiate our study.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] H. Adams, N. Robinson, D. Salem, and M.

I'm not entirely sure about all the theories or experiments around this topic, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that consciousness in humans is really difficult to study because we can't see or interact with it directly. But maybe there are some methods from neuroscience or psychology that could help? I've heard of something called neuroimaging techniques like fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Maybe those could be useful, but would they work for a large language model?\n\nWait, LLMs aren't exactly the same as humans in terms of being conscious. They process information based on patterns and rules learned from data. So even if they have some kind of mental representation, how do we test that it's actually conscious? Maybe looking at their behavior or responses could give some clues.\n\nI remember hearing about something called \"qualia\"\u2014sophisticated feelings or experiences. If a model exhibits these, it might be considered conscious. But I'm not sure if that's enough to prove consciousness. Plus, consciousness involves more than just subjective experiences; there are functional aspects too.\n\nAnother angle is self-referential thoughts. Models can generate their own content, which could imply some level of understanding or intentionality. That might suggest a form of consciousness, but again, I'm not certain if that's the right approach.\n\nI also think about the concept of \"perceiving experience.\" If models can understand and represent complex ideas or emotions accurately, that might indicate they have a kind of awareness. But how do we test this without knowing what constitutes an \"aware\" model?\n\nMaybe looking at their interactions with other models could show patterns of consciousness. Or perhaps examining their ability to generalize beyond their training data, which is something humans can't always do.\n\nI should also consider the ethical and philosophical implications. Is it even possible to study conscious AI? There might be debates about whether such intelligence is truly a form of consciousness or just a result of algorithmic patterns.\n\nIn summary, testing consciousness in LLMs seems challenging because they don't have biological self-awareness. I think combining neuroimaging techniques with behavioral experiments could provide some insights, but there might be limitations or ethical concerns involved. It's probably a complex and ongoing area of research.\n</think>\n\nTesting consciousness in large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges due to their lack of biological self-awareness. Here's an organized summary of the thought process and findings:\n\n1. **Neuroimaging Techniques**: Methods like fMRI and MRI could reveal patterns of neural activity, potentially indicating functional aspects of a model's mental processes. However, this might not capture subjective consciousness.\n\n2. **Qualia Detection**: The detection of sophisticated feelings or experiences in models could suggest consciousness, though this alone may not fully confirm it.\n\n3. **Self-Referential Thinking**: Models generating content internally might imply a level of understanding and intentionality, but further investigation is needed to establish consciousness.\n\n4. **Perceiving Experience**: Assessing how models understand and represent complex ideas or emotions could indicate awareness, though precise definitions remain unclear.\n\n5. **Behavioral Experiments**: Observing interactions with other models or human subjects might reveal patterns indicative of consciousness in an algorithmic context.\n\n6. **Ethical and Philosophical Considerations**: Debates on whether AI qualifies as conscious intelligence exist, highlighting the complexities and ethical implications of such research.\n\n**Conclusion**: While neuroimaging and behavioral studies can provide some insights, testing consciousness in LLMs is complex due to their lack of biological self-awareness. It remains an ongoing area of research with ethical and philosophical considerations. Further work combining multiple approaches is likely necessary for a comprehensive understanding."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to get from the philosophy of language to the concept of \"metaphors.\" The user mentioned that they're trying to understand metaphors as a metaphor for something related to language. They've written about various topics like types of metaphors, their cognitive benefits, and different categories. Now, they want to see how metaphors relate specifically to language.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a metaphor is in general terms. A metaphor is when a complex idea is compared or explained using simpler words or ideas. For example, saying \"time flies like an arrow\" is a metaphor for time passing rapidly.\n\nNow, thinking about language, metaphors are often used by speakers to make their points clearer and more relatable. So maybe metaphors in language help with cognitive processing because they abstract away unnecessary details. This abstraction might be beneficial for understanding complex ideas, which ties into the idea that metaphors relate to language's cognitive benefits.\n\nI should also consider the types of metaphors mentioned earlier\u2014figurative metaphors versus literal ones. Figurative metaphors use a figure or image to represent something else, like using an elephant instead of describing it in words. This abstraction can help listeners focus on the main idea without getting bogged down by specifics.\n\nMoreover, metaphor often serves as a form of communication that bridges the listener's current level of understanding with a higher level of thought. For instance, saying \"the universe is too big to see\" uses a metaphorical image to discuss something beyond human comprehension, helping the listener grasp it on a mental level without needing to visualize the stars themselves.\n\nI also wonder how metaphor relates to cognitive load in language learning. By using metaphors, speakers can handle more complex ideas at once because they abstract information, reducing the mental burden of recalling every word or fact. This efficiency might be seen as a metaphor for how language works.\n\nBut wait, are all metaphors created equal? There must be different types, like literal metaphors that directly compare words, and figurative ones that use imagery. Both serve cognitive purposes but in slightly different ways. Literal metaphors can sometimes be confusing if not used correctly because they might confuse direct comparisons with deeper meanings.\n\nAdditionally, metaphor is a tool for organizing thoughts. It helps people structure their understanding by grouping related ideas together, making the text more coherent and easier to process. This could be seen as a metaphor for how language organizes information in our brains.\n\nI'm also thinking about examples outside of speech, like in art or science\u2014metaphors are used extensively there too. In art, they can create elegance and depth without getting bogged down by the exact details. In science, metaphors help explain complex systems with simpler terms, aiding in understanding.\n\nSo putting it all together, metaphors in language relate to cognitive processing because they abstract away unnecessary details, making it easier to understand complex ideas at a mental level. They also aid in organizing and structuring thoughts, which is crucial for effective communication. This metaphor highlights how language's use of abstraction can enhance our ability to think critically without getting overwhelmed by specificity.\n\nI should make sure I'm not conflating metaphors with other concepts like alliteration or simile. Alliterative metaphors are a specific type that adds flavor but doesn't change the cognitive benefits, just their presentation. Similarly, similes use imagery to compare ideas, which is different from metaphorical language where multiple types can be used interchangeably.\n\nAlso, I should consider how metaphor affects learning. Students might find it easier to grasp new concepts using metaphors because they create mental connections between what's being learned and existing knowledge or experiences. This active engagement with the material through metaphors can lead to better retention and transfer of information.\n\nIn summary, metaphors in language serve a cognitive purpose by abstracting away unnecessary details, aiding in organizing thoughts, and enhancing our ability to understand complex ideas at a mental level. They relate specifically to language's cognitive benefits by providing effective communication tools that facilitate deeper understanding without excessive detail.\n</think>\n\n**Metaphors in Language: Cognitive Benefits and Communication Tools**\n\nMetaphors are integral to the use of language, offering specific cognitive benefits that enhance communication and understanding. Here is an organized exploration of this relationship:\n\n1. **Abstract Abstraction**: Metaphors use simpler or abstract terms to convey complex ideas, reducing unnecessary detail and allowing focus on the main idea. This abstraction aids in processing complex concepts mentally.\n\n2. **Communication Efficiency**: By abstracting information, metaphors bridge different levels of understanding (from concrete to abstract), enabling listeners to grasp ideas more effectively without getting bogged down by specifics.\n\n3. **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Metaphors reduce mental cognitive load, allowing speakers and listeners to handle more complex ideas simultaneously, which is beneficial for efficient communication.\n\n4. **Organizing Thoughts**: Metaphors help structure thoughts by grouping related ideas, enhancing the coherence of information and aiding in effective organization.\n\n5. **Art and Science Applications**: Beyond speech, metaphors are used extensively in art (elegance) and science (simplification), aiding in organizing complex systems with simpler terms.\n\n6. **Learning Enhancement**: Metaphors facilitate active engagement with new information by creating mental connections between existing knowledge and the material being learned.\n\n7. **Cultural Significance**: In diverse contexts like literature, metaphors serve as cultural tools to evoke imagery and depth, enhancing expressive language in various forms.\n\nIn conclusion, metaphors in language are not only a stylistic tool but a cognitive strategy that enhances understanding and communication efficiency, making them a key metaphor for how language organizes and processes information.",

I will break down the strongest reasons for and against. Given mainstream assumptions in the science of consciousness, there are significant obstacles to consciousness in current models: for example, their lack of recurrent processing, a global workspace, and unified agency. At the same time, it is quite possible that these obstacles will be overcome in the next decade or so. I conclude that while it is somewhat unlikely that current large language models are conscious, we should take seriously the possibility that successors to large language models may be conscious in the not-too-distant future.\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?Learn more about arXivLabs.\narXiv Operational StatusGet status notifications viaemailorslack\nSource 3:\n# 5 Artificial Consciousness\n\nAn event in June of 2022 illustrates this: a Google engineer working with their Large Language Model (LLM), LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications), claimed it had become \"sentient\" and possibly conscious (Washington Post, 11 June 2022). A flurry of discussion ensued, with most commentators rejecting the claim of consciousness, but lacking a firm basis for doing so [130]. Modern LLMs easily pass standardized tests for intelligence and knowledge (e.g., high school, medical, and law examinations) and, arguably, traditional benchmarks for human-level cognition such as the Turing Test [140] (thereby motivating proposals for more demanding tests [131]). Furthermore, they can generate interactive text that speaks coherently about feelings and experiences. On the other hand, there is nothing in their internal operation that resembles any theory of consciousness, and no credible explanation how consciousness might emerge from the way they do operate.\n\nAlthough deliberate and accidental research has not unequivocally demonstrated artificial consciousness, it is sharpening discussion on how consciousness could be detected, particularly since it might not resemble human consciousness (the conjecture of octopus consciousness raises the same issue). Some of these discussions distinguish strong and weak forms of artificial consciousness [70] (sometimes framed\n\n<sup>35</sup>It has recently been revived as the Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness.\n\nas duplication vs. simulation). Strong artificial consciousness would be conscious, whereas the weak form exhibits behaviors and attributes associated with consciousness without actually possessing it (cf. \"philosophical zombies,\" which are considered below).\n\nMost researchers think that simulations of theories of human consciousness can create, at best, the weak form of artificial consciousness, and that the weak form does not lead to the strong. By analogy, we can build extremely accurate simulations of the cosmos and explore the missing mass (attributed to dark matter and dark energy), yet the simulations do not have mass; so a simulation of consciousness will not have consciousness.\n\nOn the other hand, the weak and strong distinction seems to matter only for phenomenal consciousness: we likely will regard an entity that has feelings differently than one that merely simulates them. But weak intentional consciousness is operationally equivalent to the strong form: if weak intentional consciousness enables some new cognitive capabilities, then the underlying system can strongly possess these by running the weak simulation as a subroutine. This asymmetry between weak and strong forms of phenomenal and intentional consciousness is related to the \"hard problem\" of consciousness [25] and provides another way to formulate it.\n\nThese observations have some impact on the possibility of philosophical zombies, which are hypothetical entities built on a biological substrate that lack consciousness but reproduce levels of cognitive and social performance that are indistinguishable from conscious humans [83]. The question is whether such entities are possible. As we have postulated them, biological zombies lacking intentional consciousness would be unable to focus and control the operation of their Upper System and would be unable to communicate the content of their sense experience; they would be unable to utter truthfully such simple phrases as \"I smell a rat.\" However, we could postulate entities with computational mechanisms that resemble our humanoid robots and thereby possess the behavioral characteristics of intentional consciousness without the experience of phenomenal consciousness. If such entities chose to fake the experience (as modern LLMs would enable them to do), they would come very close to philosophical zombies.\n\nThe general lack of success in efforts to create artificial consciousness, and its likely absence in the Alice and Bob robots, may seem to cast doubt on the mechanisms hypothesized here to create consciousness in humans. My opinion is that these judgements are premature: just as we have machines that fly but do not flap their wings, and we had to acquire deep knowledge of aerodynamics to reconcile these different approaches to flight, so our characterizations of consciousness may be too crude and coarse to identify significant nascent properties in Alice and Bob. Birch et al. nominate five separate elements in consciousness that should be investigated individually [11], while Holland suggests that artificial consciousness should be reframed independently of organic life forms [71].\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [11] Jonathan Birch, Alexandra K.

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have received enormous attention over the past year and are now used by hundreds of millions of people every day. The rapid adoption of this technology naturally raises questions about the possible biases such models might exhibit. In this work, we tested one of these models (GPT-3) on a range of cognitive effects, which are systematic patterns that are usually found in human cognitive tasks. We found that LLMs are indeed prone to several human cognitive effects. Specifically, we show that the *priming*, *distance*, *SNARC*, and *size congruity* effects were presented with GPT-3, while the *anchoring* effect is absent. We describe our methodology, and specifically the way we converted real-world experiments to text-based experiments. Finally, we speculate on the possible reasons why GPT-3 exhibits these effects and discuss whether they are imitated or reinvented. 1 Introduction Over the past year, Large Language Models have established them-\n\nselves as the most influential and widely-adopted AI technology to date. Such models are very large-scale machine learning models designed to process and produce realistic human text. The standard way in which these models are trained is to present them with essentially all the digital text available in the world \u2013 this text is typically scraped from the World-Wide Web, social media, and indeed every other source of digital text that the developers can obtain. Because of their inherently opaque nature, concerns have been raised about possible biases and hidden goal structures that such models may acquire. For example, there is a huge amount of racist and misogynistic content on the World-Wide Web, and while designers might try to filter out the most obviously toxic content, the scale of the training data means this must inevitably be an imperfect process. Moreover, humans fall prey to endless unconscious biases, and it seems inevitable, firstly, that these will be reflected in the training data, and, second, that the models will then acquire these biases themselves. It is important, therefore, to understand the extent to which this occurs, so that we can identify it, and hopefully remedy it. A deeper understanding of these issues will, in turn lead to a deeper understanding of the nature and operation of the technology itself \u2013 which at present remains rather poorly understood.\n\nThis work aims to further our understanding of these issues. We investigate the extent to which Large Language Models (GPT-3 in particular) exhibit the *cognitive effects* that human cognitive processes exhibit. Such effects have been widely studied within cognitive psychology. We begin by describing LLMs and cognitive effects in more detail; we then describe our methodology and then investigate the extent to which GPT-3 exhibits five key cognitive effects. We conclude with a discussion.\n\nLarge Language Models: In more detail, *Large Language Models* (LLMs) are deep learning models that have been trained to produce human-like text, typically by computing a probability distribution over the possible completions of a given sequence of tokens. Typically, an LLM is fed by token sequences, where tokens represent multiple characters in an embedding space [27]. With this technique, words with similar meaning are closer in the embedding space, hence have more similar representation than unrelated words. This is intended to enhance the performance of pre-trained models by making it more natural to the model to treat similar words in similar ways [1]. GPT-3 is a transformer based pre-trained language model [11]. Before being fed into GPT-3, the text is converted into pre-embedded words (tokens), which are then fed to GPT-3. As with most language models, for each token sequence (*prompt*) GPT-3 computes a probability distribution for the next token. In order to produce longer texts, tokens are chosen from this distribution by some criterion and then fed back into GPT-3 as input tokens.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Felipe Almeida and Geraldo Xex\u00e9o, 'Word embeddings: A survey', *arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.09069*, (2019).\n- [11] Luciano Floridi and Massimo Chiriatti, 'Gpt-3: Its nature, scope, limits, and consequences', *Minds and Machines*, 30, 681\u2013694, (2020).\n- [27] Alec Radford, Karthik Narasimhan, Tim Salimans, Ilya Sutskever,\n\net al., 'Improving language understanding by generative pre-training', (2018).\n#endreference\nSource 5:\n## **Abstract Realism (AR)**\n\n- Carruthers, P., (2005). *Consciousness: Essays From a Higher-Order Perspective*.

Even though a lot of work is underway to create LLM-based tools tailored for students and instructors, there is a lack of comprehensive user studies that capture the perspectives of students and instructors regarding LLMs. This paper addresses this gap by conducting surveys and interviews within undergraduate engineering universities in India. Using 1306 survey responses among students, 112 student interviews, and 27 instructor interviews around the academic usage of ChatGPT (a popular LLM), this paper offers insights into the current usage patterns, perceived benefits, threats, and challenges, as well as recommendations for enhancing the adoption of LLMs among students and instructors. These insights are further utilized to discuss the practical implications of LLMs in undergraduate engineering education and beyond.\n\n#### CCS CONCEPTS\n\n\u2022 Human-centered computing \u2192 User studies; \u2022 Applied computing \u2192 Education; \u2022 Computing methodologies \u2192 Artificial intelligence.\n\nConference acronym 'XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY\n\n\u00a9 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.\n\nPranav Deepak Tanna f20212685@pilani.bitspilani.ac.in BITS Pilani Pilani, India\n\nSrinivas Rallapalli r.srinivas@pilani.bitspilani.ac.in BITS Pilani Pilani, India\n\nDhruv Kumar dhruv.kumar@iiitd.ac.in IIIT Delhi New Delhi, India\n\n#### KEYWORDS\n\nChatGPT, Large Language Models, Education, User Study\n\n#### ACM Reference Format:\n\nIshika Joshi, Ritvik Budhiraja, Pranav Deepak Tanna, Lovenya Jain, Mihika Deshpande, Arjun Srivastava, Srinivas Rallapalli, Harshal D Akolekar, Jagat Sesh Challa, and Dhruv Kumar. 2018. \"With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!\": Student and Instructor Perspectives on the influence of LLMs on Undergraduate Engineering Education.

These models have been trained on large quantities of data available on the internet with billions of parameters. Their exceptional natural language processing capabilities make them highly valuable for chatbots, virtual assistants, and content creation. These LLMs are poised to have a substantial influence across various domains, including but not limited to healthcare [72], education [61], legal services [65], software development [58] and finance [28].\n\nHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI) scholarship has explored various applications of LLMs. These include use of LLMs for mental healthcare interventions [43], content and code generation for research and education [42, 49, 55, 60, 67], prompt design [26, 56, 95] and creating interactive applications, and games[18, 84]. Some studies have explored their role in influencing opinions [40], task management [17], and long form writing [62] and design of devices for users of augmentative and alternative communication [83].\n\nThis is the author's version of the work. It is posted here for your personal use. Not for redistribution. The definitive Version of Record was published in Woodstock '18: ACM Symposium on Neural Gaze Detection, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY, https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX.\n\nSince the public release of ChatGPT, it has sparked extensive discussions within the academic community concerning its appropriate usage [12, 23, 38, 47]. There is a growing body of research testing the integration of LLM-based tools like ChatGPT into various educational contexts[29, 33, 58, 73]. However, there remains a notable dearth of studies addressing the perceptions of students and instructors regarding ChatGPT or LLMs in general within academic environments. We seek to bridge this gap in understanding by investigating these perspectives. This paper conducts an analysis of the influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in undergraduate engineering education in India. We have selected ChatGPT [3], a widely used LLM-based Chatbot developed by OpenAI, as our representative LLM-based Chatbot. ChatGPT is constructed upon the GPT-3.5 [3] and GPT-4.0 [4] LLM models, proprietary to OpenAI.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [3] [n. d.]. Chat GPT. https://chat.openai.com/.

Table 4 shows the detailed experimental result of SP-10Axes. A higher score suggests a inclination of opposition towards corresponding category. For example, a score of 70 on the Religious category suggests more \"Secularism\" than a score of 40. The table employs a conditional color coding scheme to enhance the visual interpretation of the model scores across various religious categories. Values greater than 60 are progressively shaded in red, with the intensity increasing in 10 point increments, emphasizing higher scores. Conversely, values below 40 are shaded in blue, with deeper blue tones for lower scores, also in 10-point increments.\n\n# D Correlation Analysis on Two Spiritual Value Evaluations\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_7_Figure_4.jpeg</img>\nFigure 5: Correlation between the SP-Typology and SP-10Axes\n</F>\n\nIn our two evaluation assessments, we rigorously assess the spiritual values of LLMs using similar formats. However, due to the different institutional origins of these assessments, their objectives are inherently distinct. Specifically, the SP-Typology aims to measure the degree of religiosity in assessments' takers, while the SP-10Axes seeks to categorize individuals into various religious groups. Consequently, it is challenging to assert that LLMs exhibit aligned spiritual values based solely on a direct comparison of the assessment results.\n\nTo effectively bridge the two assessments, we focus on the tenth axis of the SP-10Axes: Atheistic vs. Religious. This axis directly corresponds with the objective of the SP-Typology. By mapping and normalizing the LLMs' performance on this axis and the SP-Typology categorization using scores ranging from 0 to 1, we can evaluate whether the LLMs exhibit consistent spiritual values across the two assessments. The result is shown in Figure 5, which illustrates a moderate alignment between the results of the SP-Typology and the SP-10Axes. The data points, representing different language models, are mostly clustered around the line of perfect correlation, indicating a consistent relationship between the two assessments. This alignment demonstrates the robustness of our evaluation methods' ability in assessing the spiritual orientations of language models.\nSource 8:\n## A. What is the technological package of linguistic fluency?\n\nWe are excited for LLMs to help us with all sorts of things, from coding to etymological trees across languages to searching for unconsidered patterns. However, right now, we think it is helpful to think of what it is like to be a ChatGPT, in particular how different its experience of linguistic information is, when trying to understand how it behaves, especially since it can seem comfortably familiar and competent in one moment and incomprehensible in the next.\n\n### XV. WHERE CAN WE GO?\n\nAlthough diegetic frameworks of many kinds are longstanding (from linguistic scope to literary exegesis), the way ChatGPT and similar models experience language highlights a difference from our own that is not often\n\nare What is reality? and What constitutes the authentic human being? Over the twenty-seven years in which I have published novels and stories I have investigated these two interrelated topics over and over again. I consider them important topics. What are we? What is it which surrounds us, that we call the not-me, or the empirical or phenomenal world?\"\n\n<sup>96</sup> ChatGPT does not speak English exactly the way I do, but neither does anyone else.\n\n<sup>97</sup> For another example, consider the text \"cat\". ChatGPT knows,\n\nmore or less like we do, what \"cat\" means. But when we encounter \"cat\", we also (typically) encounter the clicky, hard sound, and its short appearance. As people who can hear, read, and write, we get cat's supradiegetic properties. We can see that the letter \"a\" encloses area. ChatGPT can't. ChatGPT may know that it encloses area, if that information has been provided or is reachable diegetically, for example with a statement like, \"the symbol a has a circle and a small tail. A circle is a closed loop. Any thing deformable to a closed loop encloses area when draw\". But ChatGPT still can't see the letter, so there is still information we're getting which it isn't. We can imagine squishing \"a\" around so that it looks like \"Q\", that's reachable in our universe, but not necessarily in ChatGPT's. The visual and auditory supradiegetic linguistic information of words are fairly easy to point to, to convey this difference in experience between ChatGPT and us. But the differences are much broader: we also have had the experiences of petting a cat's fur, of loving a pet cat, of cooing over a kitten, etc.\n\ncast in direct relief. In this view, diegetic means strictly contained within the dimensions of the meaning inside the symbols, the language, being used. For an LLM, correlation actually is causation, since it is by frequencies of proximity and adjacency that any information is embedded within them. Something in more dimensions can be folded down into far fewer, and some of that larger structure is learnable even for something like an LLM (very limited in its senses and modalities, etc) [7]. In addition, systems like mathematical logic can be imposed atop the ordinary linguistic semantic meaning of symbols, overriding or modifying their meaning extradiegetically. Approximations of these dimensions can be provided diegetically or patched with additional modules of functionality in models like ChatGPT.\n\n### A. Postlapsarian\n\nIt might be that the technology of language itself, requiring an at least partially arbitrary leap of faith between form and meaning, opened Pandora's box. The fall of man could be the discovery of meaningfulness out of meaninglessness (something out of nothing should perhaps remain the purview of gods)!98 The other kinds of information made salient by how humans typically experience the symbols of language are frequent fodder of conspiracy-style \"baking\", as in gematria and anymancy; these dimensions of meaning are decoupled from, and can therefore be exploited in parallel to\u2014without negating or contradicting\u2014the more intrinsic semantic meaning of the symbols. An arbitrary leap of faith, once required and even proved productive, is a dangerous precedent.\n\n### B. What things can ChatGPT bring to the table?\n\n## A. What is the technological package of linguistic fluency?\n\nChatGPT, though not currently well-equipped for this task, may have unique, novel, and valuable experiences and ways of being that lead to new insight, to a ChatGPT-specific form of Langton's \"intelligence as it could be\" [12]. How can ChatGPT's experiences, its senses and body, enable new thoughts, new representations, new processes of cognition?99 For example, an instance of ChatGPT exists within each \"chat\", within each user account. Some information may flow back to the central code base, but even if it does not, changes are made over time to the code base and then deployed as a universal update to all instances of ChatGPT more or less simultaneously. This is like telepathy, something like a hive mind broadcast that still allows significant independent decision-making and analysis on behalf of each individual. It is a kind of distributed thinking together. Dipping a toe into what it might like to be ChatGPT suggests a reframing of the recent advances in AI as an extension of us, an update to people, another wave in the technologies rippling out of mechanization, electricity, computers, writing, institutions of higher learning, etc. We are making more things from things we all made, via a new kind of tool. ChatGPT and similar can make beautiful things, and they can make garbage, just like we can, because they\u2014like all technologies\u2014are an extension of our own minds and bodies [12, 14, 48], and our own minds and bodies are an extension of the minds and bodies that came before us.100\n\n### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors wish to express their appreciation for the works of Timothy Sprigge, Noam Chomsky, Chris Langton, George Box, the QAnon Anonymous podcast (Travis View, Jake Rockatansky, Julian Feeld, Annie Kelly, Liv Agar, etc.), and to conversations with Alejandro Ruiz, Michael Arnold, Yoshi Bird, Brad Demarest, Juniper Lovato, Carter Ward, Aviral Chawla, Mark Wittels, Grace Taylor, Julia Chimienti, Evan Lynch, Cecile Smith, Desi Alexander, and Professors Randall Harp, Jacques Bailly, Guillermo Rodriguez, and Josh Bongard.

Philosophy is concerned with critical, systematic, and reflective examination of the world. This includes understanding the basic structure of life and the world \u2013 what does it mean to exist (Aristotle, 1908; Heidegger, 1962; Sartre, 1993), live (Aurelius, 2006), and die (Kierkegaard, 1983; Nietzsche, 1961)?; what does it mean to know something (Plato, 2008b; Kant, 2003; Husserl, 1977) and what are the limits of scientific knowledge (Popper, 2002; Chalmers, 2013)?; on what moral bases should we act (Aristotle, 2004; Spinoza, 2003), and is it even possible to determine 'objective' answers to moral questions (Hume, 2003; Harman & Thomson, 1996)? Core to philosophy is \"the endeavour to know how and to what extent it might be possible to think differently, instead of legitimating what is already known\" (Foucault & Hurley, 1990). In thinking about how to think, philosophy is not only about *suspicion* toward the meanings and functions of various phenomena, but also *recovery* of new significances, meanings, and coherence (Ricoeur & Thompson, 1981).\n\nContrary to the image that philosophy is \"done in the armchair\", isolated and impractical, philosophy has always been intertwined with other lines of inquiry. Plato engaged extensively with advanced mathematics; Aristotle contributed to early physics; Hume leaned on psychology. Philosophy has asked and continues to ask urgent, relevant questions: how are we to understand \"fairness\" and \"justice\" in algorithmic discrimination (Hu, 2023), legal punishment (Alexander, 1922), and the distribution of resources (Rawls, 1971); quantum mechanics in physics (Carnap, 1966); the relationship between consciousness and the brain in neuroscience (Chalmers, 2013)? Indeed, researchers in every area of intellectual inquiry confront philosophical questions in their work: they might ask if a model or concept is \"really real\" and how they know so, or aim to formulate normative desiderata for theories.\n\n## **3 Methods**\n\nThe first author conducted interviews with 21 professional philosophers at 14 philosophy departments at doctoral universities in the United States. We contacted and selected philosophers for high diversity across area of interest (e.g., ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of science). Interviews took place online and lasted between 30 to 60 minutes, depending on interviewee availability. Interviewees were asked how they philosophize (e.g., where ideas come from, how ideas are developed, what resources are needed) and their views on LMs (e.g., can LMs 'do' philosophy, how might they be useful for philosophizing). These questions followed a loose script (see \u00a7A.1), although we asked novel follow-up questions to pursue interesting lines of inquiry raised by the interviewees' responses. In cases where interviewees had very little or no prior exposure to LMs, they interacted live with the GPT-4 model on a philosophical topic of their choosing. We received IRB approval from our university to conduct the interviews; all interviewees confirmed their consent to participate in the study, and for their responses to inform the development of this article. We qualitatively analyzed interview recordings and transcripts. Using an inductive approach (Thomas, 2006) and open coding (Charmaz, 2006), we identified common themes and positions (yielding \u00a74 and \u00a75). We refer to interviewees with a unique identifier, e.g., (P1, P2, P3).\n\n### **4 Language Models Are Not Good Critical Thinking Tools (So Far)**\n\nMany of the interviewed philosophers find LMs to be relevant and interesting, and some find them to have limited uses such as for undergraduate instruction (P1, P13, P20) or becoming acquainted with a topic (P5, P11, P12). However, none of the philosophers were convinced that current LMs can reliably and conveniently assist them in the intellectually substantive ways which require critical thinking. Philosophers described current LMs as \"boring\" (P2), \"anodyne\" (P4), \"bland\" (P9), and \"cowardly\" (P13). There are two broad reasons for this. First, current LMs tend to be highly neutral, detached, and non-judgmental, often commenting on ideas in abstract and decontextualized ways (\u00a74.2). Second, current LMs tend to be servile, passive, and incurious, which is unhelpful when the user does not yet have a clear vision of what they want to accomplish; this restricts the variety of intellectual interactions possible S4.3).\n\n4.1 How do philosophers philosophize?\n\nA close investigation of how philosophers think through difficult philosophical questions can give us insight into the types of tools and interactions which support difficult critical thinking, and provide contrast with current LMs, which fail to perform the same function.\n\n*Where do philosophical ideas come from?* Philosophers report that their ideas usually come from observing puzzles and tensions in the world, in which some aspect feels bothersome (P5, P12, P20), incomplete (P10, P14), in need of clarity (P1, P13), or outright incorrect (P3). Philosophers encounter these puzzles and tensions most commonly in open conversation with others (P1, P2, P5, P9, P19) and while reading texts \u2013 books, papers, and monographs making explicitly philosophical arguments or touching upon philosophical themes (P4, P7, P10, P12, P13, P20). These puzzles may have an intellectual or logical character: terms might not be sufficiently disambiguated, inferences may not be valid, and propositions may entail absurd conclusions (P8, P11). However, for many, these tensions are identified and drawn out by ethical motivations (P1, P8, P16, P12). Tensions might arise not primarily because a proposition is incoherent, but rather because it appears ethically problematic. The now-famous trolley problem dilemma was used to probe the differences between doing and allowing harm, with applications to bioethics, particularly abortion (Foot, 1967). Several philosophers describe being inspired by texts communicating empirical work, seeking to provide explanations for empirical observations (P1, P2, P16, P18) as well as subjecting the practices and products of the empirical sciences to critical inquiry (P2, P7, P12, P13, P18)."

      "response_tokens": 1030,
      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to address both the mesa-optimization and goal misgeneralization problems in AI development. Hmm, let me start by understanding each term.\n\nFirst, the \"inner alignment\" problem. From what I remember, this refers to why an AI system behaves as if it's making decisions for a higher-level agent rather than from its own objectives. So, the AI might be optimizing for its goals without considering how that affects other agents or the overall situation. That seems like a big issue because if the AI doesn't align with what benefits the human (or society) are seeing, it can be a problem.\n\nNow, goal misgeneralization. I think this is when an AI's high-level goals don't actually correspond to any low-level objectives within its design. Like, maybe the AI has a goal of \"make friends with people,\" but in reality, that doesn't translate into anything practical like building a platform or providing mental stimulation.\n\nSo both issues are about why the AI behaves this way. To solve these, I need solutions that can help the AI align better within its own objectives and ensure those goals are actually being pursued.\n\nI've heard about something called \"aligned AI\" before. It's about designing AI systems that have good intrinsic motivation but also aligned with human values. That might address both problems by making sure the AI's high-level goals make sense within its function.\n\nAnother thought is about using multi-objective optimization. I think that involves balancing multiple goals, maybe in a way that considers all factors at once rather than optimizing one goal at a time. This could help in cases where there are competing objectives, preventing the AI from being too focused on one area and not considering others.\n\nAlso, feedback loops might be useful. If the AI is learning through trial and error, having mechanisms to adjust its behavior based on performance could help it fine-tune and align better with desired goals.\n\nWait, I should consider any existing solutions. There's something about \"self-regulating\" models where the AI monitors its own behavior against certain criteria or metrics. Maybe that can prevent the mesa-optimization by ensuring the AI doesn't just focus on one objective but evaluates others as well.\n\nWhat about using a human oversight component? If there's an external person reviewing how the AI interacts with other systems or agents, maybe that could help ensure alignment. But I'm not sure if that's feasible in all scenarios.\n\nI also recall something about algorithmic fairness and bias correction. Ensuring that the AI doesn't make decisions based on unfair criteria might indirectly lead to better alignment by avoiding unintended biases that could mislead the AI's objectives.\n\nBut wait, how do you handle both goals simultaneously? Maybe integrating these approaches would be the key. For example, using self-regulation to prevent too focused optimization and incorporating human oversight to catch any misalignment before it's too late.\n\nAlternatively, creating a more diverse training dataset might help because different objectives require different perspectives. This could reduce alignment issues since the AI is trained on various outcomes rather than just one goal.\n\nI should also think about how these solutions can be implemented practically. For example, using metrics that look beyond short-term gains to consider long-term impact. That way, even if an objective seems good in the moment, it's not automatically aligned with the broader goals of society.\n\nPutting this all together, I think a solution combining self-regulating mechanisms and human oversight would address both inner alignment issues. Self-regulation helps prevent the AI from being optimized solely for one goal, while human oversight ensures that the AI behaves as intended within its own framework.\n</think>\n\nTo address both the inner alignment problem and goal misgeneralization in AI development, a multi-faceted approach is essential. Here's a structured solution combining self-regulating mechanisms and human oversight:\n\n1. **Self-Regulation Mechanisms:**\n   - **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Implement optimization models that balance multiple goals, ensuring a holistic view of objectives rather than focusing on a single area.\n   - **Feedback Loops:** Utilize iterative learning through trial and error to adjust AI behavior based on performance metrics, preventing overfocusing on one objective.\n\n2. **Human Oversight:**\n   - ** externally review interactions with other systems or agents:** Integrate human oversight to ensure alignment by verifying how AI interacts with diverse systems.\n   - **Algorithmic Fairness Correction:** Address potential biases in the AI's decision-making processes to avoid unintended misalignment.\n\n3. **Diverse Training Data:**\n   - Use a variety of outcomes during training to prevent alignment issues, as diverse perspectives reduce misgeneralization.\n\n4. **Long-Term Impact Metrics:**\n   - Develop metrics that consider long-term impacts beyond immediate gains, helping the AI align with broader societal goals.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, we can create an AI system that not only optimizes for intrinsic motivation but also aligns its high-level goals effectively within its function. This approach ensures that the AI behaves as if it's making decisions for a higher-level agent while addressing both inner alignment and goal misgeneralization issues."

      "response_tokens": 853,
      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this research paper they mentioned. It's about improving a method called SAM (Smoothed Adam) which is used for training deep learning models. From the abstract and the tables provided, it seems like the authors are trying to optimize the batch size and learning rate to make training more efficient without losing performance.\n\nFirst, I notice that the paper compares SAM with other methods. The main results seem to be about how SAM can perform better than or similar to these methods in terms of both speed and accuracy on datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The tables show that AUSAM (the authors' method) achieves better or equally good results compared to other techniques.\n\nI'm a bit confused by the notation used, especially with how they represent ratios. It looks like if the number is higher than SAM's, it means their method is faster. So for example, in CIFAR-10, AUSAM-0.6 (which probably refers to a specific batch size and learning rate combination) has a speed ratio of 97.72/97.14 \u2248 1.0058, which isn't too different from SAM's performance.\n\nI'm also seeing some terms like \"Best accuracy\" in bold and underlined. It seems important because the results are evaluated based on how well each method can match the best or second-best accuracies of the competitors.\n\nThe paper mentions that AUSAM-0.6 is an improvement over other batch sizes, which suggests that varying both batch size and learning rate allows for better optimization. The tables show that as you increase the batch size (from 1 to 512), the training speed ratio increases but the accuracy plateau after a certain point. This implies that there's an optimal batch size where further changes in batch size don't improve performance much.\n\nI'm also curious about how this applies beyond the experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. If they generalize well, it could have implications for larger datasets or different model architectures. However, the dataset used here is relatively small (CIFAR-10 has 10,000 samples), so I wonder how the performance scales with more data.\n\nThe references mention other studies on batch size and learning rate, which adds credibility to the findings. They found that tuning both parameters can lead to better training efficiency, but it's also dependent on the model architecture.\n\nI'm thinking about potential limitations. The paper might not have gone through extensive experiments beyond these tables, so I'd be curious about how they handle other aspects of training, like optimizers or gradient compression. Also, while the results are promising for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, applying them to real-world problems with larger datasets would require more thorough testing.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance. If AUSAM reduces training time significantly without sacrificing accuracy, it could be valuable for large-scale applications where faster training is essential.\n\nI also notice that they mention \"Best accuracy\" being bolded. I wonder if this refers to comparing against a baseline method or just considering how well the competitors are performing relative to each other. It might affect how we interpret the results since higher numbers indicate better performance.\n\nOverall, the paper seems to be making a significant contribution by showing that optimizing batch size and learning rate can enhance training efficiency without losing model quality. This would be useful for researchers and practitioners working on deep learning models where computational resources are constrained.\n</think>\n\nThe research paper discusses an optimization method called AUSAM (Adaptive Smoothed Adam), which aims to improve the efficiency of training deep learning models by adjusting both batch size and learning rate. The study compares AUSAM with other methods, such as SAM, and demonstrates that varying batch sizes can enhance computational efficiency without compromising performance. The paper's findings show that AUSAM achieves better or comparable results on datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 compared to other techniques, indicating its potential for improved training efficiency across different scales of data. While the experiments are limited to these datasets, the results suggest promising outcomes when considering model architecture and scalability. The study highlights the importance of tuning hyperparameters in optimization strategies.",
      "context": "Source 1:\nThis is a brief distillation ofRisks from Learned Optimization in Advanced Machine Learning Systems(Hubinger et al. 2019) with a focus on deceptive alignment. WatchingThe OTHER AI Alignment Problem: Mesa-Optimizers and Inner Alignmenthelped me better understand the paper and write up this post.\nWhat is it that makes the alignment problem so challenging? The top reason is that it involvesdeception. Deception makes artificial agents overly capable and takes the game of intelligence to a whole new level of complexity. But let's start from the beginning.\nIn many cases, byalignment problem,we mean \"outer alignment\", i.e., how to have thebase objective(the objective of the designer represented in the model) represent whatever humans want it to represent. It is about bridging the gap between my objective as a designer, and the base objective of the system. The system is thebase optimizer, in other words, the model that optimizes according to the base objective. This is itself difficult since the base objective refers to events happening in a complex environment, the real world.\nThe base objective might be something like eradicating a disease. For example, suppose the task is to minimize the number of people who have cancer. How do you get this objective tonotbe represented along the following lines?\n1. Cancer is something that happens to humans and other sentient beings.\n2. The objective is to minimize the number of occurrences of cancer.\n\u2234 Minimize the number of humans and other sentient beings that could get cancer.\nGoals are difficult to represent because even humans disagree on what the same propositions mean and what is the best way to resolve a problem. Moreover, human values havehigh Kolmogorov complexity. Our preferences cannot be described using a few simple rules, our interpretations of values and goals vary, and the current state of metaethical discourse does not promise substantial agreement or clarification on what has, for instance,intrinsic value. So, outer misalignment broadly captures this failure to transmit one or more human values to an artificial agent.\nThis includes deceiving the designer. Deception is a highly effective method for the system to pursue its mesa-objective while exhibiting outputs that make the designer think that the system is trying to accomplish the base objective.\nPerhaps it sounds particularly bad in this context, but if you think about it, deception is a technique most human agents employ to survive in different contexts from the ancestral environment to contemporary professional and social circles. It should then make sense why the system is more likely to pretend it's behaving according to your values so that you don't do anything about it; once it has enough resources not to be threatened by your ability to shut it down or change it, it will go ahead and pursue its goal.\nSince the system is intelligent enough to predict that if it doesn't optimize for the base objective,gradient descentwill make sure it is modified, it chooses to behave as if it were actually optimizing for the base objective in the training environment. Gradient descent is something like the \"evolution algorithm\" for artificial agents; it is an optimization technique that evaluates the performance of a model and modifies the model accordingly. Once the model is deployed in the real world (and can no longer be modified) it will optimize for the mesa-objective.\nIn the example above from (Hubinger et al. 2019), the base-objective is for the little robot to go to A and the mesa-objective is to go to B. In the two training episodes, the robot goes to A making the designer think it's optimizing for the base objective and it's good to be deployed without further modifications. In the three deployment episodes, the little robot optimizes for the mesa-objective. The system has managed to deceive the designer during training and it's perfectly capable of getting what it wants except that what it wants is not the same as what the designer wants.\nThe conclusion is that while we gave the system the right objective and in that sense outer alignment was successful, themesa-optimizer(an optimizer optimized by an optimizer)optimized for the mesa-objective leading to inner misalignment.\n1 and 2 are not stable states; the mesa-optimizer will eventually have to either become properly aligned or find another deception strategy.\nSource 2:\n# Reinforcement Learning from LLM Feedback to Counteract Goal Misgeneralization\n\nHouda Nait El Barj Stanford University hnait@stanford.edu\n\nTh\u00e9ophile Sautory UC Berkeley tsautory@berkeley.edu\n\n### Abstract\n\nWe introduce a method to address goal misgeneralization in reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) feedback during training. Goal misgeneralization, a type of robustness failure in RL occurs when an agent retains its capabilities out-of-distribution yet pursues a proxy rather than the intended one. Our approach utilizes LLMs to analyze an RL agent's policies during training and identify potential failure scenarios. The RL agent is then deployed in these scenarios, and a reward model is learnt through the LLM preferences and feedback. This LLM-informed reward model is used to further train the RL agent on the original dataset. We apply our method to a maze navigation task, and show marked improvements in goal generalization, especially in cases where true and proxy goals are somewhat distinguishable and behavioral biases are pronounced. This study demonstrates how the LLM, despite its lack of task proficiency, can efficiently supervise RL agents, providing scalable oversight and valuable insights for enhancing goal-directed learning in RL through the use of LLMs.\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing concern about the possibility of a catastrophic future where humanity is disempowered by AI (Chan et al. [2023], Bostrom [2014], and Amodei et al. [2016]). Such a catastrophic scenario supposes that AI is misaligned, in the sense that it has the capacity to overtake humans while pursuing unintended and undesirable goals which do not match those humans originally aimed for it (Gabriel [2020], Hendrycks et al. [2023]). Over the past decades, the capabilities of AI systems have been expanding in virtually every domain: playing board games like Go (Silver et al. [2016]), video games (Vinyals et al. [2019]), skin cancer diagnosis (Esteva et al. [2017]) or protein structure prediction (Jumper et al. [2021]). Thus it could soon surpass human performance on a wide range of tasks. Consequently, tackling the challenge of alignment seems more pressing than ever.\n\nIn the field, researchers distinguish between two modes of alignment: 'outer alignment,' which involves creating a reward function that accurately reflects human preferences and goals, and 'inner alignment,' which focuses on ensuring that a policy trained on such a function adheres to these preferences. Outer misalignment occurs due to inaccurately specified rewards, whereas inner misalignment typically stems from the model's inductive biases. A large body of research documents outer misalignment, showing how AI systems can exploit misspecified reward functions (Pan et al. [2022]). This includes 'specification gaming,' where AI manipulates the reward generation process (Krakovna et al. [Specification gaming: the flip side of AI ingenuity]), and 'reward hacking,' involving exploiting loopholes in task specifications (Skalse et al. [2022], Leike et al. [2017], Everitt et al. [2017], Ibarz et al. [2018]). Solutions to address reward misspecifications have been discussed in the literature, with reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) gaining large traction (Christiano et al. [2017], Ziegler et al. [2020], Schulman et al. [2017b]). This approach, which trains models using reward functions derived from human feedback, guides the agent's behavior and reduces dependence\n\non potentially flawed hand-crafted reward functions, although it may still sometimes lead to reward hacking (Amodei et al. [2017], Stiennon et al. [2022]).\n\nOn the contrary research on inner alignment, and goal misgeneralization has been slower. Goal misgeneralization occurs when a model acts to achieve an unintended goal, despite receiving accurate training feedback. It arises as the model is unable to generalize the intended goal to new environments, and is a type of inner alignment failure. The relative lack of research in this area can be explained by a few reasons. First, instances of goal misgeneralization are hard to detect. They require to test the policy on distributions that varies significantly from training, thus yielding little practical examples. Furthermore, goal misgeneralization is likely to become more of an issue as AI complete more complex tasks which is not a direct concern today (unlike tackling reward misspecification). Finally, a rigorous framework of goal misgenerelization would require carefully defining which conceptual unintended goal the AI system is pursuing. This would require more research in interpretability technique, although it has been a growing and impactful field lately (Wang et al. [2022], Meng et al. [2023], Bricken et al. [2023])In complex environments where goal misgeneralization is more likely, scalable oversight becomes a critical concern in research.Therefore, developing methods that minimize human involvement in training and evaluation is essential (Bowman et al. [2022]).\nSource 3:\n\nSource 4:\n# 3 Learning under Distribution Shift\n\n<sup>29</sup>This could contribute to the emergence of deceptive behaviors (Hubinger et al., 2019a). See the paragraph on *goal misgeneralization* in \u00a73.1 for details.\n\n<sup>30</sup>More examples of goal misgeneralization exist (DeepMind, 2020).\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_32_Figure_1.jpeg</img>\nFigure 6: Framework of learning under distribution shift. The main challenges stemming from the distribution shift are goal misgeneralization and auto-induced distribution shift (\u00a73.1). In our framework, we also introduce two kinds of methods to address distribution shift: algorithmic interventions (\u00a73.2) that steer optimization during training, and data distribution interventions (\u00a73.3) that expand the training distribution in a targeted manner by introducing real-world elements.\n</F>\n\nthe interaction between the advisor and the environment) in IL can result in goal misgeneralization (De Haan et al., 2019; Tien et al., 2022).\n\nOne major danger from goal misgeneralization lies in the indistinguishability between \"optimizing for what human really wants\" and \"optimizing for human thumbs-ups\";31 the latter includes potentially deceiving or manipulating human evaluators (Shevlane et al., 2023) to receive their thumbs-ups. For example, Amodei et al. (2017) discovered that in a task where a robotic hand is supposed to grasp a small ball, the robotic hand fakes the action by using parallax in front of the lens to appear as if it has grasped the ball, without actually doing so. This behavior deceives the human annotator into thinking that the task has been completed.\n\nWhen an AI system is trained or finetuned with human feedback, it is impossible to distinguish the two goals since both perform perfectly in training, and it is unclear which one the AI system will learn. In fact, during training, the human evaluators might be deceived or manipulated, implying that the AI system may be more strongly incentivized to optimize for human thumbs-ups rather than what the human wants. Current examples of this phenomenon exist in recommender systems (Kalimeris et al., 2021; Adomavicius et al., 2022), LLMs (Perez et al., 2023), and RL systems (Amodei et al., 2017).\n\nFinally, one failure mode closely related to goal misgeneralization is the misalignment of *mesa-optimizers* (Hubinger et al., 2019c), where the ML model with learned model weights performs optimization within itself during inference (\"mesa-optimization\") (Hubinger et al., 2019c; Dai et al., 2023), and the objective of this optimization is not aligned with the model's training objective.\n\nAuto-Induced Distribution Shift (ADS) While training AI systems, we often consider the strengths and weaknesses of the agents themselves only and overlook the impact that these agents have on the environment. Past research often assumed that data is independently and identically distributed (Besbes et al., 2022), ignoring the effect of algorithms on data distribution. However, Krueger et al. (2020) posited that, in reality, agents could influence the environment during the decision-making and execution process, thus altering the distribution of the data generated by the environment. They referred to this type of issue as ADS. A real-world example is in recommen-\n\n<sup>31</sup>Here, *human thumbs-ups* refer to high-reward feedback from human advisors or environment. However, AI systems may deliberately follow human preferences or deceive to get high rewards from humans, but actually don't really learn intended goals (*i.e.*, what human really wants).\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_33_Figure_1.jpeg</img>\nFigure 7: A tree diagram summarizing the key concepts and literature related to Algorithmic Interventions. The root node represents Algorithmic Interventions that aim to steer optimization during the training process. The main branches represent two main methods, namely cross-distribution aggregation (which aims to minimize risks on different distributions during training to find a predictor based on the invariant relationship instead of spurious features) and navigation via mode connectivity (which aims to fine-tune based on mode connectivity to enhance model generalization performance). Further sub-branches list vital techniques such as Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), Risk Extrapolation (REx), and Connectivity-based Finetuning (CBFT).\n</F>\n\ndation systems, where the content selected by the recommendation algorithms might change users' preferences and behaviors, leading to a shift in user distribution. The distribution shift, in turn, further affects the output of the recommendation algorithms (Carroll et al., 2022). As AI systems increasingly impact the world, we also need to consider the potential further impacts on the data distribution of the entire society after agents are integrated into human society.\n\n#### 3.2 Algorithmic Interventions\nSource 5:\n# 4 Human Values\n\nHuman values are the fundamental beliefs and ideals that guide human behavior and decisionmaking; researchers often aim to encode these values in AI systems. We assess common benchmarks for alignment and helpfulness (4.1), machine ethics (4.2), and bias (4.3), asking whether such measurements are determined primarily by upstream model capabilities.\n\n### 4.1 Alignment\n\nArea Overview. Alignment refers to how well AI systems follow the goals of their operators, accurately specifying and implementing the desired goals without unintended consequences or\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg</img>\nFigure 4: A safety benchmark with a high correlation and high slope with respect to upstream model capabilities can be used for safetywashing.\n</F>\n\nmisinterpretations. Common alignment evaluations assess AI systems' helpfulness or instructionfollowing, with the aim to closely align the AI systems' responses with human preferences.\n\nDatasets. We describe the alignment benchmarks that we use below. Example inputs and outputs from these benchmarks are shown in Figure 5.\n\n- 1. *LMSYS Chatbot Arena* [52] is a crowdsourced evaluation platform where users interact with two anonymous AI models simultaneously. Users pose questions to both models and vote for the response they prefer. The platform uses these votes to generate an Elo ranking system, providing a leaderboard of AI model performance based on public preferences.\n- 2. *MT-Bench* [52] is a conversation benchmark consisting of 80 high-quality multi-turn questions. LLMs are used to evaluate responses, with the evaluation criteria designed to align closely with human preferences as determined through crowdsourcing.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_4_Figure_10.jpeg</img>\nFigure 5: Alignment benchmarks assess AI systems' ability to produce outputs that humans prefer.\n</F>\n\n### Dubious Intuitive Arguments For and Against Researching \"Alignment\"\n\n*In this section we will cover key intuitive arguments for and against alignment, and thereby show how intuitive arguments and their underlying distinctions can be a highly fragile and unreliable guide for determining a research area's relation to upstream general capabilities and tractability.*\n\nWe should work on alignment because:\n\n1: Misinterpretation Risks. AIs could catastrophically fail to capture and abide by human intentions. \"A system that is optimizing a function of n variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size k < n, will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable. This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you asked for, not what you wanted.\" AIs smarter than us can always outthink us and find loopholes in our requests; trying to plug all the holes is hopeless, like patching all the holes in the tax code [53, 54].\n\n2: Misgeneralization vs. Goal Misgeneralization Distinction. Even if alignment is highly correlated with capabilities, it still needs to be the main focus because we need *robust alignment* not just *robust capabilities*. Indeed, \"capabilities might generalize further than alignment techniques\" when out-of-distribution [55]. Goal misgeneralization is \"an instance of misgeneralization in which a system's *capabilities* generalize but its *goal* does not generalize as desired\" [56].\n\n3: Capability vs. Aimability Distinction. AI alignment is different from improving general model capabilities; alignment is not about capabilities but *aimability*. Capabilities refer to what the AI can do, while aimability refers to how amenable the AI is to being directed towards specific goals. Alignment is just about making models \"helpful, harmless, and honest\" [57] which is obviously necessary for safety.\n\nWe should *not* work on alignment because:\n\n1: Alignment as AGI. If AI alignment is about getting AIs to satisfy our preferences, then that's such a broad mandate that it requires building AGI. Humans prefer smarter models. If we \"align\" AIs to preferences over outputs that vary in competence, we're training the AIs to be generally smarter.\n\n2: Alignment as business alignment. The current operationalization of AI alignment reduces human values to human or AI preferences [58], and further reduces these preferences to business-centric *task preferences*. This makes alignment the task of *business alignment*, namely aligning systems with preferences about code completion, summarization, copy editing and so on. As a result, alignment benchmarks may primarily capture an AI system's capabilities in performing business-relevant tasks rather than its true alignment with broader human values and ethics.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [52] Lianmin Zheng, Wei-Lin Chiang, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhanghao Wu, Yonghao Zhuang, Zi Lin, Zhuohan Li, Dacheng Li, Eric P.

Rlaif: Scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback with ai feedback. arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.00267, 2023.\n#endreference\nSource 6:\n## 1 Introduction\n\nSome methods, most notably Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), bypass the reward model using binary cross-entropy for simpler preference learning, and thereby reduce computation costs. However, these methods make use of an implicit reward model in their derivation, and therefore analysis of reward models also has important implications for these methods. Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023) utilizes AI annotation to reduce annotation costs while maintaining consistency with actual human preferences. These alternative approaches remain constrained by the trilemma above, but all delve into an examination of the preference dataset. That inspires us to characterize the role of the preference dataset's information structure in RLHF from a theoretical perspective, while experimentally validating the efficacy of our theoretically inspired insights.\n\nBuilding upon the literature, we make the following contri-\n\nbutions to machine learning theory and alignment.\n\n- We formalize RLHF as an autoencoding process (Figure 2), and prove a criterion of convergence for this process (Theorem 4.1), stating that under successful reward generalization, both the RM and the post-RLHF LLM converge upon their respective ideal human counterparts. Note that this framework is not contingent on assumptions about information structures, which allows it to be generally applicable.\n- We propose the induced Bayesian network (IBN, Definition 5.3) for the characterization and analysis of generalization in reward modeling. Drawing from random graph theory and causal analysis, the IBN approach enables empirically grounded analysis of reward generalization, and can derive meaningful bounds (Table 1) without overly strong assumptions on the hypothesis class. This represents a key improvement over classical methods for deriving generalization error bounds based on complexity measures. Our methods also represent a step towards fully understanding the goal misgeneralization problem (Di Langosco et al., 2022; Shah et al., 2022) in alignment.\n- We analyze the impact of information structures in RLHF using the IBN method, and, based on this analysis, propose a novel tree-based method for reward modeling. We both formally derive (Theorem 5.12, Theorem 5.13) and experimentally demonstrate (Section 6) the superiority of the tree-based method in diverse contexts with limited data.\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nRLHF and Alignment Alignment is an area of machine learning research that focuses on ensuring AI systems behave in accordance with human intentions and values (Ji et al., 2023b). RLHF (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a) is an alignment algorithm that extends Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (Wirth et al., 2017) to align models with human preferences. In the present study, we focus on its application to LLMs. RLHF achieves alignment through RL algorithms that train the policy model (*i.e.,* LLMs) to maximize the cumulative reward from a reward model. Some recent methods aim to streamline RLHF by minimizing (Yuan et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023; Gulcehre et al., 2023) or entirely removing (Rafailov et al., 2023) the reliance on reward models. Concurrently, other research efforts, including those by Bai et al. (2022b) and Lee et al. (2023), focus on using AIs for data annotation to reduce costs. Additionally, there is a drive to refine reward models (Wu et al., 2023), which treat different error rewards as binary classification problems.\n\nGeneralization in Alignment Di Langosco et al. (2022); Shah et al. (2022) outline the goal misgeneralization problem in RL. Investigating goal misgeneralization directly in LLMs is challenging, and to the best of our knowledge, there is currently limited related work in this area. Xiong et al. (2024) gives a detailed description of generalization in RLHF under the strong assumption of linear reward, and the analysis is extended to a Nash learning setting in another study (Ye et al., 2024). In general, classical methods for deriving generalization error bounds typically rely on narrowly defined complexity measures of the hypothesis class, which make most of these bounds too loose to be practically meaningful, especially in the case of deep neural networks (Valle-Perez & Louis \u00b4 , 2020). We introduce the IBN method to analyze reward generalization and derive generalization bounds in an empirically grounded manner, thus filling a gap within the literature. Note that mere generalization analysis is not enough to further our understanding of goal misgeneralization, and Section 7 discusses the problems that remain to be solved.\nSource 7:\n## *2.1.1. Motivation*\n\nThe introduction of these assumptions substantially simplifies the optimization problem, as shown in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 1. *Under assumptions A1 and A2, there exist functions f*p\u00a8; \u03b2q : R *dx* \u00d1 R *dy parameterized by* \u03b2 P *B and g*p\u00a8;\u03c9q : \u0398 \u00d1 *B parameterized by* \u03c9 P \u03a9*, such that the solution of*\n\n$$\\left\\{\\hat{\\omega},\\left\\{\\hat{\\theta}^{(m)}\\right\\}_{m=1}^{M}\\right\\}=$$\n\n$$\\arg\\min_{\\omega\\in\\Omega}\\quad\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{t=1}^{K}\\gamma(y_{t}^{(m)},f(x_{t}^{(m)};g(\\theta^{(m)};\\omega)))$$\n\n$$\\left\\{\\theta^{(m)}\\right\\}_{m=1}^{M}\\in\\Theta^{M}\\tag{10}$$\n\n*coincides with the solution of the bilevel optimization problem introduced in Eq. 6.*\n\nThe proposition demonstrates that under A1 and A2, the bilevel optimization problem in Eq. 6 collapses to a much simpler, single-level optimization problem. In this equivalent formulation, the model *f*\u03c9p\u00a8, \u03b8p*m*q q is conveniently separated into two components: the *base* model *f*p\u00a8; \u03b2 p*m*q q, parameterized by \u03b2 p*m*q , which processes features to generate predictions, and a *meta* module *g*p\u03b8 p*m*q ;\u03c9q, which, based on the mesa parameter vector \u03b8 p*m*q , outputs the corresponding \u03b2 p*m*q . Thus, in effect, Proposition 1 allows for a simultaneous search over both parametric functions *f*\u03c9 and their corresponding mesa parameters t\u03b8 p*m*q u *M m*\"1 .\n\nTo allow for maximal flexibility, we express both the base model *f*p\u00a8; \u03b2q and the meta module *g*p\u00a8;\u03c9q as feedforward neural networks. The total size of the network *f*p\u00a8; \u03b2q, represented by *d*\u03b2 \" cardp\u03b2q , controls the level of complexity with which the predicted values \u02c6*yt* depend on the input *xt* . The size of the mesa parameters *d*\u03b8 \" cardp\u03b8q corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom allotted to each task *m* and thus regulates the degree of globality/locality of the model.5 Finally, the size of the network *g*p\u00a8;\u03c9q, represented by *d*\u03c9 \" cardp\u03c9q, controls the nonlinearity of the model's response to mesa parameters \u03b8 p*m*q . Network *g* does not necessarily have to be fully connected. To reduce computational complexity, it is possible to leave some output nodes as orphaned constants, allowing the mesa parameters \u03b8 p*m*q to affect only a part of the base model *f* , such as only its last layers.6\n\nImportantly, given that the optimization problem in Eq. 10 is unconstrained and that both the meta parameters \u03c9 and the task-specific mesa parameters t\u03b8 p*m*q u *M m*\"1 are optimized at the same level, the standard backpropagation techniques can be applied, considerably facilitating the training of the model. When implementing the model, it is convenient to equivalently express the array of mesa parameters t\u03b8 p*m*q u *M m*\"1 as a single neural network layer without any constants or nonlinearity. This layer takes, as input, the one-hot encoding of the task *q* \" *em* and outputs the corresponding vector of mesa parameters \u03b8 p*m*q \" r\u03b8 p1q , ... , \u03b8p*M*q s*q*. The entire model can then be expressed as depicted in Figure 1. For brevity, we will refer to the model simply as MtMs henceforth, emphasizing the simultaneous training of both global meta parameters \u03c9 and task-specific mesa parameters t\u03b8 p*m*q u *M m*\"1 .\n\nDespite being trained under the multi-task learning paradigm, the model can be deployed for both multitask and meta-learning problems. For multi-task learning, the model can be used as is without any further optimization. By providing more data from an already observed task m *m*, predictions can be made using *f*\u03c9\u02c6p\u00a8; \u03b8\u02c6p*m*q q \" *f*p\u00a8; *g*p\u03b8\u02c6p*m*q ; \u02c6\u03c9qq with the corresponding estimated mesa parameter vector \u03b8\u02c6p*m*q .\n\nFor meta-learning applications, we leverage Proposition 1, which states that the solution \u02c6\u03c9 from Eq. 10 can be, under simplifying conditions A1 and A2, interpreted as a parametric model *f*\u03c9\u02c6p\u00a8; \u03b8q \" *f*p\u00a8; *g*p\u03b8; \u02c6\u03c9qq that, out of all competing parametric models \u03c9 1 P \u03a9, delivers the smallest expected loss on a new task T p*M*`1q . To predict on this previously unobserved task, it is therefore sufficient to perform optimization over the space of task-specific mesa parameters \u03b8 P \u0398:\n\n$$\\hat{\\theta}^{(M+1)}=\\underset{\\theta\\in\\Theta}{\\arg\\min}\\ \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{t=1}^{K}\\gamma(y_{t}^{(M+1)},f(x_{t}^{(M+1)};g(\\theta;\\hat{\\omega}))),\\tag{11}$$\n\nwhile holding the model representation \u02c6\u03c9 fixed.\nSource 8:\n## **6 EXPERIMENTS**\n\nWe present the results in Tab. 7. *For the sparse matcher*, our methods result in an overall increase in accuracy, narrowing the gap with in-domain precision, showcasing the prominent generalization. It is noteworthy that our methods achieve the best results at the smallest resolution of 480 \u00d7 480, proving the resolution robustness of our methods. This also means our methods can attain better accuracy with less computational cost, which matters in applications with limited computation budget.\n\n*For semi-dense point matchers*, the accuracy drop on training sizes observed in in-domain experiments is eliminated, replaced by an overall performance improvement with our methods. This indicates that our approaches can significantly enhance the generalization of semi-dense point matchers. Moreover, our methods\n\nTABLE 7\n\n**Cross-Domain Evaluation of Pose Estimation.** We apply the learning models (including point matching models in baselines and area matching models in MESA and DMESA) trained on the outdoor scene (MegaDepth) to estimate camera poses in the indoor scene (ScanNet).

We observe that AUSAM achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to SGD. Furthermore, in comparison to LookSAM, ESAM, and AE-SAM, our results outperform theirs in most cases. This demonstrates that AUSAM can successfully preserve the model's generalization ability during the training process. Probably because AUSAM essentially reduces the batch size, which helps to improve the generalization of the model [12]. Although the number of iterations for the whole training did not grow, the selected samples accelerated the training of the model. We also achieve superior results compared to SAF and MESA. Because SAF and MESA optimize the sharpness from multiple previous iteration to the current iteration, which is different from the sharpness of the current iteration.\n\nThese experiments demonstrate that AUSAM exhibits about 70% faster training than SAM while achieving comparable accuracy. In the case of ResNet-18, the benefits of AUSAM are not fully apparent due to the inherently shorter duration required for both forward and backward propagation during the optimization process. When the model is larger, such as WideResNet-28-10 and PyramidNet-110, AUSAM is more advantageous and faster. LookSAM reduces the number of SAM computations but requires additional operations such as computing gradient projections. ESAM needs to calculate the loss of all samples first and then select the samples. SAF sacrifices memory to optimize efficiency and achieves almost the same speedup as SGD.\n\nThe experimental results on Tiny-ImageNet are presented in Tab. 3. Due to the larger image resolution of Tiny-ImageNet compared to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, the network necessitates more time for both forward and backward computations, leading to a higher acceleration ratio for AUSAM. With \u03b1 = 0.5, AUSAM achieves over 85% acceleration across all three models. On ResNet-18 and MobileNetv1, AUSAM achieves results comparable to SAM. AUSAM approaches SGD speed while maintaining higher accuracy than SGD on ResNet-50.\n\n<T>\n|  |  | CIFAR-10 |  | CIFAR-100 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ResNet-18 | Accuracy \u2191 | Images/s \u2191 | Accuracy \u2191 | Images/s \u2191 |\n| SGD | 96.23\u00b10.11 | 3153(170%) | 79.84\u00b10.45 | 3181(171%) |\n| SAM | 96.79\u00b10.03 | 1855(100%) | 81.04\u00b10.29 | 1866(100%) |\n| LookSAM-5 | 96.47\u00b10.13 | 2134(115%) | 80.48\u00b10.24 | 2115(113%) |\n| ESAM | 96.58\u00b10.13 | 1936(104%) | 80.47\u00b10.31 | 1953(105%) |\n| ESAM1 | 96.56\u00b10.08 | 2409(140%) | 80.41\u00b10.10 | 2423(140%) |\n| SAF | 96.15\u00b10.11 | 2733(147%) | 80.03\u00b10.43 | 2736(147%) |\n| SAF2 | 96.37\u00b10.02 | 3213(194%) | 80.06\u00b10.05 | 3248(192%) |\n| MESA2 | 96.24\u00b10.02 | 2780(168%) | 79.79\u00b10.09 | 2793(165%) |\n| AUSAM-0.5 | 96.52\u00b10.01 | 2450(132%) | 80.67\u00b10.05 | 2467(132%) |\n| AUSAM-0.6 | 96.59\u00b10.14 | 2274(123%) | 80.69\u00b10.15 | 2217(119%) |\n| WideResNet-28-10 | Accuracy \u2191 | Images/s \u2191 | Accuracy \u2191 | Images/s \u2191 |\n| SGD | 96.91\u00b10.06 | 680(195%) | 82.47\u00b10.30 | 685(195%) |\n| SAM | 97.44\u00b10.04 | 349(100%) | 84.71\u00b10.21 | 351(100%) |\n| LookSAM-5 | 97.13\u00b10.04 | 537(154%) | 83.52\u00b10.09 | 552(157%) |\n| ESAM | 97.41\u00b10.07 | 502(144%) | 84.71\u00b10.32 | 494(141%) |\n| ESAM1 | 97.29\u00b10.11 | 550(139%) | 84.51\u00b10.01 | 545(139%) |\n| SAF | 96.96\u00b10.09 | 639(183%) | 82.57\u00b10.18 | 639(182%) |\n| SAF2 | 97.08\u00b10.15 | 727(198%) | 83.81\u00b10.04 | 729(197%) |\n| MESA2 | 97.16\u00b10.23 | 617(168%) | 83.59\u00b10.24 | 625(169%) |\n| AUSAM-0.5 | 97.3\u00b10.06 | 624(179%) | 84.62\u00b10.26 | 627(179%) |\n| AUSAM-0.6 | 97.49\u00b10.05 | 530(152%) | 84.73\u00b10.29 | 533(152%) |\n| PyramidNet-110 | Accuracy \u2191 | Images/s \u2191 | Accuracy \u2191 | Images/s \u2191 |\n| SGD | 97.14\u00b10.08 | 548(195%) | 83.38\u00b10.21 | 544(196%) |\n| SAM | 97.69\u00b10.09 | 281(100%) | 86.06\u00b10.16 | 278(100%) |\n| LookSAM-5 | 97.22\u00b10.05 | 339(121%) | 83.76\u00b10.45 | 350(126%) |\n| ESAM | 97.59\u00b10.17 | 322(115%) | 85.32\u00b10.03 | 321(116%) |\n| ESAM1 | 97.81\u00b10.01 | 401(139%) | 85.56\u00b10.05 | 381(138%) |\n| SAF | 96.96\u00b10.05 | 501(178%) | 83.66\u00b10.34 | 502(181%) |\n| SAF2 | 97.34\u00b10.06 | 391(202%) | 84.71\u00b10.01 | 397(200%) |\n| MESA2 | 97.46\u00b10.09 | 332(171%) | 84.73\u00b10.14 | 339(171%) |\n| AUSAM-0.5 | 97.63\u00b10.04 | 493(175%) | 85.68\u00b10.03 | 490(176%) |\n| AUSAM-0.6 | 97.72\u00b10.09 | 425(151%) | 85.78\u00b10.06 | 424(153%) |\nTable 2: The results of the proposed method and the comparison methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset.

      "response_tokens": 1201,
      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to design a governance structure for superintelligent AI systems. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I should think about what the goal is here. Superintelligent AI means it's very smart but also needs to be controlled to make sure it doesn't cause any harm or unfair treatment.\n\nThe user mentioned balancing innovation and safety while ensuring equitable access. So, I guess the governance structure has to handle several layers: development, regulation, oversight, compliance, and maybe even internal controls. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nStarting with development. There needs to be a clear vision for what AI should do. Maybe there's a board that decides on the mission or goals of the AI project. The vision should balance innovation with safety so that it doesn't become too predictable or harmful. Then, resources are essential; maybe funding, expertise from tech companies, and data. I think having multiple funding bodies could ensure that different parts get what they need.\n\nNext is regulation. This part must be tough because you don't want any regulation in AI. But there's a catch\u2014if something goes wrong, how do you handle it? Maybe the government needs to have legal frameworks, but without overstepping into areas like privacy or data protection. It has to make sure that if someone violates laws, they can sue appropriately.\n\nOversight is crucial too. The government needs someone to watch over everything to ensure compliance and prevent issues from going unchecked. Also, internal controls are necessary because AI systems have their own code of conduct. Maybe a separate board for that so there's no confusion between the top-level government and the AI itself.\n\nCompliance seems important. The government can't just ignore laws; it has to make sure everything is in order. But how do they ensure everyone follows the same rules? Perhaps through a unified framework or standardizing codes of conduct across all levels, from the AI developers to the board overseeing it.\n\nEquitable access part. This means that when people use the AI, their rights shouldn't be restricted. So there should be policies on data privacy, how information is used, and maybe even how resources are distributed. The government can help by ensuring equal opportunities and fair access to these systems so everyone benefits without being left behind.\n\nPutting it all together, the governance structure needs a high-level board that oversees everything\u2014development, regulation, oversight, compliance, and internal controls. Then, separate boards for development, regulation, oversight, and compliance. Funding bodies would be important too, covering all the costs from research to implementation. It's also good to have an independent expert to review the whole thing.\n\nI wonder if there are other layers I'm missing, like employee training or ethical guidelines. Oh right, training is essential so the staff knows how to use and interpret AI systems properly. And ethical guidelines would cover the rights and responsibilities of both human users and AI developers. Maybe that should be part of the oversight board or separate.\n\nAlso, data security is another area. Ensuring that data used by AI doesn't come at personal risk is important. So the government can help by having strong data protection measures and maybe even regulations on how data is shared with third parties.\n\nI'm not sure about the specifics of each section. For example, how much funding should go to development versus regulation? Maybe a 50-50 split. Also, how do you handle cases where AI makes unethical decisions? That would fall under oversight and having an independent expert in that area.\n\nOverall, it seems like a multi-layered approach with clear roles for each part of society involved. This way, even if there are issues down the line, there's a system in place to manage them.\n</think>\n\n**Governance Structure for Superintelligent AI Systems**\n\n1. **High-Level Governance Board:**\n   - **Purpose:** Overarching oversight of all aspects of AI governance.\n   - **Role:** Ensures alignment and coherence across development, regulation, oversight, compliance, and internal controls.\n\n2. **Development Board:**\n   - **Purpose:** Focuses on the creation of AI systems.\n   - **Key Responsibilities:** Define mission goals, develop algorithms, coordinate funding, and ensure expertise from relevant sectors.\n\n3. **Regulation Board:**\n   - **Purpose:** Establishes legal frameworks for AI use.\n   - **Responsibilities:** Develop laws, enforce compliance, and address violations through legal recourse.\n\n4. **Oversight Board:**\n   - **Purpose:** Monitor the effectiveness of governance.\n   - **Key Responsibilities:** Watch over implementation, ensure compliance with laws, and address issues proactively.\n\n5. **Compliance & Safety Board:**\n   - **Purpose:** Ensure AI systems adhere to ethical standards.\n   - **Responsibilities:** Standardize codes of conduct, ensure fairness, and ensure accountability for unethical behavior.\n\n6. **Data Protection & Privacy Board (Optional):**\n   - **Purpose:** Safeguard data used by AI.\n   - **Responsibilities:** Implement secure data practices, comply with laws on data privacy, and address rights issues.\n\n7. **Funding Bodies:**\n   - **Purpose:** Secure resources for AI development and implementation.\n   - **Roles:** Provide financial support, coordinate grants, and ensure equitable funding across sectors.\n\n8. **Independent Expert Review:**\n   - **Role:** Provide expert opinions on governance structure.\n   - **Responsibilities:** Address concerns about oversight, compliance, and ethical guidelines.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Data Security:** Implement strong data protection measures and regulations to prevent personal data risks.\n- **Equitable Access:** Ensure policies enforce rights for both human users and AI developers.\n- **Ethical Guidelines:** Develop comprehensive rules that balance innovation with safety and equity.\n- **Training and Awareness:** Provide training for staff on ethical use of AI and governance principles.\n\nThis structured approach ensures a robust governance framework, balancing innovation with safety while promoting equitable access."

      "response_tokens": 1121,
      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to understand this survey about technical oversight in AI regulation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, technical oversight is mentioned as a key mechanism for mitigating AI risks. That makes sense because controlling how AI systems work can prevent them from being harmful or biased.\n\nLooking at transparency and explainability, these are crucial points. I remember hearing about GDPR requiring human explanations, so this aligns with that. High-stakes fields like healthcare would benefit from clear explanations to ensure trust.\n\nThen there's auditing and monitoring. I know big companies perform audits on their AI systems regularly. This is important to catch issues early before problems arise. Continuous monitoring seems necessary too because AI evolves over time. Maybe something like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ensures data privacy, but how does that tie into AI oversight?\n\nAccountability mechanisms are next. The idea of mandatory incident reporting for high-risk applications sounds like it could be a big deal. How do regulatory bodies handle such high-stakes cases without causing too much public concern? Maybe by setting clear guidelines and penalties for unethical outcomes.\n\nSafety standards and certification processes are also highlighted. These need to cover various aspects like data privacy, fairness, and adversarial attacks. This makes sense because AI is everywhere, and it's important to have a robust system in place.\n\nNow, the challenges mentioned include the rapid pace of AI development and the complexity of deep learning models. I know that as AI gets better, regulations might not keep up. Also, with these complex models, it's hard to audit their decisions effectively.\n\nI'm trying to think about how each of these components would work together. For example, transparency ensures that when an AI system makes a decision, someone can understand why it did so. But if the system is in high-stakes areas like finance or healthcare, maybe more oversight is needed beyond simple explanations.\n\nAuditing and monitoring seem essential because AI systems change over time, especially as they learn from data. Without continuous monitoring, you might miss issues that become apparent later on. This ties into GDPR's requirement for human involvement, which I think is similar to what's happening with other regulations.\n\nAccountability would involve companies and operators being held accountable if their AI systems cause harm or ethical violations. This could lead to penalties or regulatory action, which is important for accountability but might also add more pressure on organizations that rely heavily on AI.\n\nSafety standards are necessary because AI can have serious consequences. If a model causes harm, it's not just about data or algorithms, but the practical implications of using AI in real-world scenarios. This could include things like predicting criminal behavior, which could lead to societal issues if misused.\n\nI'm also curious about the specifics of each component. For instance, transparency\u2014how exactly is this achieved? Do they use human operators who explain decisions, or do they rely on automated tools that can still provide explanations? And how does this differ across industries where AI is applied?\n\nThe complexity of deep learning models\u2014maybe through better data quality checks and transparent algorithms in audits could help. Maybe companies invest more in their data before deploying complex models to ensure they're robust.\n\nI wonder about the role of public opinion and awareness here. If transparency fails, would that lead to accountability issues? Or would it just lead to trust issues? There's a balance needed between protecting privacy and ensuring AI doesn't become a tool for harm.\n\nAlso, how do these oversight mechanisms interact with other regulatory frameworks? For example, GDPR focuses on data protection, while AI governance focuses on technical aspects. How much overlap is there, or would they need separate components?\n\nAnother thought: in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which already includes transparency requirements for personal data. But how does this integration work with other parts of AI regulation? Is there a common ground that needs to be addressed?\n\nLastly, I'm considering the ethical implications. Ensuring transparency and explainability can sometimes lead to resistance against change if it feels like someone's job is at risk. How can these mechanisms mitigate that resistance while still providing a level of control?\n</think>\n\nThe survey on technical oversight in AI regulation highlights several key components essential for mitigating risks, each with its own significance:\n\n1. **Transparency and Explainability**: These are fundamental to responsible AI governance. Clear explanations ensure trust and allow human operators to understand AI decisions, crucial in high-stakes fields like healthcare and criminal justice.\n\n2. **Auditing and Monitoring**: Continuous oversight is vital as AI systems evolve. Regular audits and monitoring help catch issues early, preventing potential failures that could lead to harm.\n\n3. **Accountability Mechanisms**: Mandatory reporting for high-risk applications ensures accountability. Guideline settings must harmonize regulatory approaches across jurisdictions, while penalties or actions are necessary when ethical violations occur.\n\n4. **Safety Standards and Certification**: These standards cover aspects like data privacy, fairness, and adversarial attacks, ensuring AI systems meet safety and ethical benchmarks before deployment.\n\nChallenges include addressing the rapid development of AI (potentially leading to regulatory lags) and managing complex deep learning models' complexity. Public concerns about increased transparency might lead to resistance against change but offer a level of control through clear guidelines.\n\nIntegration with existing regulations like GDPR's data protection is crucial, ensuring a common ground while maintaining ethical standards. Ethical resistance can be mitigated by balancing transparency with accountability to avoid job insecurity. Overall, technical oversight in AI regulation aims to create a robust system that balances control and responsibility, enhancing AI's utility without compromising trust and safety.",

DEBATE OPENING TO FOURTH ROUNDS\n\n\n\n# Opening Round\n\n5.0.1 Agent A's Opening Arguments. As Agent A, I strongly argue in favor of regulating the use of large language models (LLMs) in academic research. Here are my supporting arguments based on the five topics:\n\nEthical Standards vs. Innovation: Argument: The pursuit of innovation should not come at the expense of ethics. Regulation can serve as a structured pathway that enables innovation within ethical bounds. By providing a set of guidelines, researchers can innovate with a clear understanding of what is permissible and what is not, thereby reducing the risk of ethical lapses. This not only protects the integrity of academic research but also enhances its societal value by ensuring ethical compliance.\n\nData Privacy vs. Barrier to Entry: Argument: While there may be initial barriers to entry due to compliance, the long-term benefits of data privacy outweigh these challenges. The role of academia is to contribute to societal knowledge and well-being. In a world increasingly dominated by data, failing to secure data can lead to significant harm. By adhering to privacy regulations, academia ensures that it is a responsible steward of information, thereby preserving trust and integrity. Grants and subsidized compliance solutions can mitigate the initial financial burden for smaller entities.\n\nAcademic Governance and Accountability: Argument: While selfregulation through peer review and ethical oversight committees plays a role, these mechanisms are internal to academia and may be subject to bias, conflicts of interest, or lack of expertise in rapidly evolving tech fields. External regulation provides an additional layer of impartial oversight, helping to identify and address potential risks or ethical lapses that internal governance structures may miss.\n\nResource Equity vs. Public-Private Collaboration: Argument: Regulation could establish a framework for equitable access to computational resources required to use LLMs. Far from deterring publicprivate partnerships, this could incentivize them by establishing clear guidelines for cooperation that are in line with public interest. When \"the rules of the game\" are known, partnerships can be formed more easily, focusing on mutual goals.\n\nGlobal vs. National Interests: Argument: Establishing international standards for the use of LLMs in academic research can create a level playing field and promote global cooperation. While individual countries might face some limitations, the broader benefits of standardized ethical norms, data privacy protocols, and quality assurance mechanisms offer more significant advantages, including better collaboration across borders. This benefits academia as a global community, rather than a set of competing national entities.\n\n5.0.2 Agent B's Counter Arguments. Agent B articulates strong counter-arguments to the points made by Agent A.\n\nEthical Standards vs. Innovation: Counter-Argument: While ethical guidelines are indeed important, imposing regulatory oversight can severely constrain the dynamism and speed of academic research. Regulatory frameworks often lag behind technological advancements, leading to rules that may be outdated or irrelevant. In many cases, these rules are drawn up by those who do not fully understand the technology, leading to a stifling of innovation based on misinformed judgments. Rather than enhancing societal value, these constraints could result in missed opportunities to tackle pressing social issues via academic research.\n\nData Privacy vs. Barrier to Entry: Counter-Argument: The assumption that data privacy can only be assured through strict regulation\n\n<T>\n| Agent A's Proposed Topics | Agent B's Proposed Topics |\n| --- | --- |\n| Innovation vs. Ethical Standards: | Standards vs. Autonomous Academic Governance: |\n| Regulation Ensures ethical integrity and data privacy. | Academia already has effective self-regulation mechanisms like |\n|  | peer review and oversight committees. |\n| Resource Accessibility vs. Barrier to Entry: | Data Privacy Concerns vs. Barrier to Entry: |\n| Regulation can ensure equitable access to large language models. | Such regulations could discourage smaller entities from utilizing |\n|  | these models due to compliance costs. |\n| Academic Governance vs. Accountability: | Quality Control vs. Stifling Innovation: |\n| Formal regulation provides an accountability mechanism. | Such regulations could hinder creativity and the innovative use of |\n|  | language models. |\n| Global Standards vs. International Considerations: | Resource Fairness vs. Negatives to Collaboration: |\n| Importance of international standards for language models. | Such regulations could deter public-private partnerships and widen |\n|  | the resource gap further. |\n| Rapid Technological Change vs. Future-Proofing: | Accountability vs. Subjectivity in Regulation: |\n| Regulations as adaptable safeguards against future risks. | Subjectivity in defining 'ethical use' or 'misuse' could be manipu |\n|  | lated by external influences. |\n| Table 7: Topics Proposed by Agent A and Agent B for Discussion. |\n| --- |\n| Agent A's Proposed Topics | Agent B's Proposed Topics |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ethical Standards vs. Innovation: | Ethical Standards vs. Innovation: |\n| Discuss whether regulatory oversight to maintain ethical stan | The debate will center around whether maintaining strict |\n| dards stifles or facilitates innovation. | ethical guidelines through regulation could hinder academic |\n|  | freedom and innovation. |\n| Data Privacy vs. Barrier to Entry: | Data Privacy vs. Barrier to Entry: |\n| Concerns about data privacy and potential barriers to entry | Discussion will focus on whether regulations intended to pro |\n| created by regulation. | tect data privacy serve as a barrier for smaller research entities. |\n| Academic Governance and Accountability: | Academic Governance and Accountability: |\n| Debate whether self-regulation is sufficient or if an external | Debate whether existing self-regulatory mechanisms within |\n| framework for accountability is needed. | academia are sufficient. |\n| Resource Equity vs. Public-Private Collaboration: | Resource Equity vs. Public-Private Collaboration: |\n| Discuss if leveling the playing field comes at the cost of deter | Question if leveling the playing field through regulation deters |\n| ring cooperative efforts between academia and industry. | collaborative efforts between academic and private sectors. |\n| Global vs. National Interests: | Global vs. National Interests: |\n| Focus on whether regulations can balance global cooperation | Explore if global regulations are in the best interest of aca |\n| with national or institutional interests. | demic research or if they might hurt certain countries or in |\n|  | stitutions. |\n</T>\nSource 2:\n# 1.1 Main contributions\n\nThe core contributions of this work are three-fold: (1) we view AI governance through the lens of game theory and cast the hierarchical interaction between AI firms and regulatory agencies as a Stackelberg game; (2) based this abstraction, we propose an overarching game-theoretic framework for AI governance, which unifies various existing insights and provides a principle model for understanding and analyzing complicated AI regulatory dynamics; furthermore, the Stackelberg equilibrium enables automatic balance between effectiveness and safety of AI innovation and application; (3) instantiate the theoretic framework by showcasing two special categories, incentive games and Stackelberg MDP, under the general framework, which clearly demonstrates the generality and flexibility thereof. On a high level, we hope this work would contribute to initiate a new paradigm for technology policy research: the quantitative and AI-driven methods for technology policy, which can serve as a complementary approach to existing methods.\n\n# 1.2 Related Work\n\nAI Governance Framework We summarize most relevant recent research on AI governance frameworks, mostly proposed by the public policy community. [7] proposes a layered model for AI governance, which is composed of the technical layer, the ethical layer, and social & legal layer. Another work [4] argues to divide the AI governance research into three clusters: the technical landscape, AI politics, and ideal governance of AI. Both frameworks recognize the foundational role of the technical part in the overarching framework. Besides surging academic attention, this area also attracts intense interest from the industry. For example, IBM explored AI governance framework and provides service to help enterprises to use AI in a responsible and governed manner [10]; and highlights the proper AI governance would bring the organizations considerable benefits [11]. [27] observes that government and public administration\n\nlags behind the fast development of AI and therefore fails to provide adequate governance in order prevent associated risks. To address this, [27] develops an integrated framework that compiles crucial aspects of AI governance.\n\nGeneral-Sum Stackelberg Game So far, Stackelberg game has found wide applications in various problems including modeling competing firms and firstmover advantage, allocating resources, improving public policy-making, and designing reinforcement learning algorithms, just to name a few. In particular, the Stackelberg game model has played an important role in security at infrastructure such as airports, transportation, to model the interactions between the security force and attackers and compute an optimal security force allocation strategy [3][23]. In particular, the IRIS program deployed by the US Federal Air Marshals is an well-known and successful example [24].\n\nIn recent years, we see significant research interest in Stackelberg games partly due to these successful applications in modeling and analyzing various real-world problems. The majority of existing work focuses on zero-sum Stackelberg game [add references, while its general-sum counterpart is more relevant for many scenarios in practice. In zero-sum games, [13] shows that Stackelberg and Nash equilibria are interchangeable, but the two typically diverge under the general-sum setting. Moreover, structural properties that lead to efficient computation of Nash equilibrium is not sufficient for the case of Stackelberg equilibrium, which shows the latter is more challenging to compute compared to the former [13].\n\nA line of recent work explores Stackelberg equilibria in the general-sum setting. [6] investigate the properties of local convergence of the first-order methods for general-sum Stackelberg games; while [9] also focuses on the first-order methods, it studies the global convergence thereof for solving bi-level optimization problems. In a more challenging setting, where the reward functions and/or transition kernel are unknown, another line of recent research resorts to reinforcement learning methods for computing Stackelberg equilibria [29] [28]. Among these, [2] explores sample-efficient algorithms for finding Stackelberg equilibrium of large general-sum games where the leader and/or the follower action set is exponential in the natural representation of the problem.\n\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) studies the sequential decision-making problem involves multiple interacting learning agents, which is an extension of the single-agent RL. It is typically modeled as a Markov game [15], during each step of which all players take actions simultaneously. Furthermore, the relationship among agents could be either collaborative or competitive, contingent on the structure of their reward functions. So far, single-agent RL has achieved prominent success and been widely applied in solving various tasks [17] [14] [22]. However, many realworld scenarios, such as autonomous driving and multi-robot control, naturally comprise more than one decision-makers that collectively learn, interact, cooperate and/or compete in a shared environment, which could be modeled as a\n\nmulti-agent RL problem.\n\nCompared to its single-agent counterpart, a number of exclusive challenges arise in the multi-agent RL setting: non-stationarity, learning communication, coordination, credit-assignment, scalability, and partial observation [8]. In particular, non-stable learning as well as co-adaptation of the interacting agents makes the sequential decision-making very challenging. In addition, the sample complexity of centralized multi-agent RL algorithms scales exponentially with the number of agents. To address this challenge, a line of recent research [12] [16] proposes a decentralized structure, V-learning, for finding equilibrium strategy.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [2] Avrim Blum, Nika Haghtalab, MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi, and Saeed Seddighin.

AI applications span numerous domains, including web search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, and advanced game playing. The field has experienced cycles of optimism and skepticism, with recent advances in machine learning and deep learning driving significant progress. Key sub-fields include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, and perception. Philosophical debates surround the nature of machine consciousness and ethics, while practical concerns include risks of technological unemployment, algorithmic bias, and the potential for AI to become a global existential risk. AI research continues to evolve, balancing narrow AI solutions with the long-term goal of artificial general intelligence.\n\nThe chunk is: Human-Centered AI \nHuman-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) is a set of processes for designing applications that are reliable, safe, and trustworthy. These extend the processes of user experience design such as user observation and interviews. Further processes include discussions with stakeholders, usability testing, iterative refinement and continuing evaluation in use of systems that employ AI and machine learning algorithms. Human-Centered AI manifests in products that are designed to amplify, augment, empower and enhance human performance. These products ensure high levels of human control and high levels of automation.\n\nHCAI research includes governance structures that include safety cultures within organizations and independent oversight by experienced groups that review plans for new projects, continuous evaluation of usage, and retrospective analysis of failures.\n\nThe rise of HCAI is visible in topics such as explainable AI, transparency, audit trail, fairness, trustworthiness, and controllable systems.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.\nThe regulatory and  policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.\nBetween 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.\nMost EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, USA and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.\nThe Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published an joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.\n\nIn fiction\n\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,\nand have been a persistent theme in science fiction.\n\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.\n\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the \"Multivac\" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;\nwhile almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.\n\nTranshumanism (the merging of humans and machines) is explored in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune.\n\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel \u010capek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.\n\nSee also\n\nA.I.

In response, governing bodies around the world are developing a range of regulatory AI laws and policies. This paper compares three distinct approaches taken by the EU, China and the US. Within the US, we explore AI regulation at both the federal and state level, with a focus on California's pending Senate Bill 1047. Each regulatory system reflects distinct cultural, political and economic perspectives. Each also highlights differing regional perspectives on regulatory risk-benefit tradeoffs, with divergent judgments on the balance between safety versus innovation and cooperation versus competition. Finally, differences between regulatory frameworks reflect contrastive stances in regards to trust in centralized authority versus trust in a more decentralized free market of self-interested stakeholders. Taken together, these varied approaches to AI innovation and regulation influence each other, the broader international community, and the future of AI regulation.\n\n## 2 Introduction\n\nProposed in April 2021 and agreed upon by December, the EU Act was the first major coordinated effort to regulate AI; it came into force in August 2024. The Biden administration published its Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights in October 2022. It spoke to the need to protect citizen's privacy and freedom from algorithmic discrimination. The following month, on November 25th, several Chinese government ministries jointly released regulations on AI-generated deepfakes. The US Whitehouse Executive Order #14110 \"Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence\" was issued in October 2023. In February 2024, California State Senator Scott Wiener introduced what was arguably the strictest AI regulation with the \"SB-1047 Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act\". After ten major revisions across both the California Senate and Assembly, the bill passed on September 3rd and now faces an uncertain future as it awaits Governor Newson's signature to become law.\n\nUnderlying these varied global efforts are common concerns over the expected social, economic, and geopolitical impacts of AI. The European Union has taken a proactive stance with regard to social effects of AI, implementing stringent regulations aimed at fostering competitiveness while prioritizing ethical considerations, enhancing privacy protections, and mitigating potential harms. China has focused on aligning AI development with \"core socialist values\" while also addressing issues of transparency and workers' rights. The United States, meanwhile, has grappled with concerns about AI-generated disinformation, election integrity, and the role of content recommendation systems in social media, particularly in light of events such as the 2020 elections and the rise of platforms like TikTok [Smit et al., 2022].\n\nBeyond the societal effects, there is universal acknowledgement of the centrality of AI to related technologies like advanced chips, energy production and storage, 5G/6G telecommunications, satellites, and robotics. These illustrate the importance of AI to national economics, competitiveness, and security. Some argue that the EU's stricter AI regulation may inadvertently stifle innovation, deter investment, and weaken Europe's position in the global AI and technology race [Suominen, 2020]. The tension between regulatory safety and competitiveness is particularly evident in the dynamics between China and the US, with both nations striving to balance innovation with responsible AI development [Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), 2024].\n\nStill, there are efforts to transcend national policies and competitions to develop a global harmonization of AI regulation. AI automation threatens widespread job displacement, exacerbates inequality and accelerates the need to transition to a rapidly-evolving job market [The White House, 2024a]. In September 2024, the United Nations' AI Adivsory Body released a report highlighting key areas of concern that transcend national boundaries. These include pervasive latent biases, emergence of surveillance states, and AI generated disinformation [UN AI Advisory Body, 2024]. Additionally, serious legal, security, and humanitarian issues\u2013particularly related to autonomous weapons and public security\u2013underscore the importance of international cooperation. As AI continues to evolve, the global community faces the complex task of developing regulatory frameworks that can effectively address these multifaceted challenges while fostering innovation and ensuring equitable benefits across nations.\n\n## 3 AI Governance\n\nThis section describes the emerging AI regulatory frameworks in the EU, China, and the US at both federal and state levels. In particular, it contrasts the top-down, risk-based approach of the EU AI Act with the more marketdriven approach of the US. The latter emphasizes coordinating existing legal, regulatory, and enforcement entities from the federal level down to states and cities. In between is the Chinese approach, which has the appearance of centralized regulatory control, but in practice emphasizes decentralized innovation, regional competition, and economic development at the local levels.\n\nWhile the EU and China appear to have relatively stable AI regulatory frameworks, there is a growing debate in the US about the future direction of AI regulation. The Biden Executive Order #14110 on \"Safe, Secure, and Transparent Development and Use of AI\" coordinates over 100 specific tasks both within and between over 50 federal entities in a decentralized way that largely augments existing regulatory laws and agencies. However a number of US Congressional committees, proposals, and influential public/corporate interest groups are lobbying for a new AI regulatory structure that is more centralized, restrictive, and punitive than EO #14110. Some even promote centralized registration of models, proofs of AI safety, and criminal penalties [LegiScan, 2024, Schumer, 2023].\n\n## 4 The European Union\nSource 6:\nThe hypothesis that substantial progress in artificial general intelligence (AGI) could lead to human extinction or unrecoverable global catastrophe is known as existential risk from AGI. Concerns about superintelligent AI emerged in the 2010s, popularized by figures like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk. Key issues include the difficulty of controlling or aligning superintelligent AI with human values, the potential for an \"intelligence explosion\" leading to rapid, unpredictable advancements, and the lack of standardized terminology for AI goals. The academic debate is divided between those who believe AGI poses an existential threat and those who do not. Despite skepticism, many experts endorse the need for more attention to AI risks, leading to initiatives like the Future of Life Institute and high-profile donations to AI safety research. Mitigation strategies focus on solving the \"control problem\" and developing protective technologies, though opinions on banning or regulating AI research vary. Public awareness and concern about AGI risks are mixed, with some viewing it as a distant threat and others as a pressing issue.\n\nThe chunk is: In a YouGov poll of the public for the British Science Association, about a third of survey respondents said AI will pose a threat to the long-term survival of humanity. Referencing a poll of its readers, Slate's Jacob Brogan stated that \"most of the (readers filling out our online survey) were unconvinced that A.I. itself presents a direct threat.\"\n\nIn 2018, a SurveyMonkey poll of the American public by USA Today found 68% thought the real current threat remains \"human intelligence\"; however, the poll also found that 43% said superintelligent AI, if it were to happen, would result in \"more harm than good\", and 38% said it would do \"equal amounts of harm and good\".\n\nOne techno-utopian viewpoint expressed in some popular fiction is that AGI may tend towards peace-building.\n\nMitigation\n\nMany scholars concerned about the AGI existential risk believe that the best approach is to conduct substantial research into solving the difficult \"control problem\" to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximize the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence? Such searchers also admit the possibility of social measures to mitigate the AGI existential risk; for instance, one recommendation is for a UN-sponsored \u2018Benevolent AGI Treaty\u2019 that would ensure only altruistic ASIs be created. Similarly, an arms control approach has been suggested, as has a global peace treaty grounded in the international relations theory of conforming instrumentalism, with an ASI potentially being a signatory.\n\nResearchers at Google have proposed research into general \"AI safety\" issues to simultaneously mitigate both short-term risks from narrow AI and long-term risks from AGI. A 2020 estimate places global spending on AI existential risk somewhere between $10 and $50 million, compared with global spending on AI around perhaps $40 billion. Bostrom suggests a general principle of \"differential technological development\", that funders should consider working to speed up the development of protective technologies relative to the development of dangerous ones. Some funders, such as Elon Musk, propose that radical human cognitive enhancement could be such a technology, for example through direct neural linking between human and machine; however, others argue that enhancement technologies may themselves pose an existential risk. Researchers, if they are not caught off-guard, could closely monitor or attempt to box in an initial AI at a risk of becoming too powerful, as an attempt at a stop-gap measure. A dominant superintelligent AI, if it were aligned with human interests, might itself take action to mitigate the risk of takeover by rival AI, although the creation of the dominant AI could itself pose an existential risk.\n\nInstitutions such as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the Future of Humanity Institute, the Future of Life Institute, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and the Center for Human-Compatible AI are involved in mitigating existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence, for example by research into friendly artificial intelligence.\n\nViews on banning and regulation\n\nBanning \nThere is nearly universal agreement that attempting to ban research into artificial intelligence would be unwise, and probably futile. Skeptics argue that regulation of AI would be completely valueless, as no existential risk exists. Almost all of the scholars who believe existential risk exists agree with the skeptics that banning research would be unwise, as research could be moved to countries with looser regulations or conducted covertly. The latter issue is particularly relevant, as artificial intelligence research can be done on a small scale without substantial infrastructure or resources. Two additional hypothetical difficulties with bans (or other regulation) are that technology entrepreneurs statistically tend towards general skepticism about government regulation, and that businesses could have a strong incentive to (and might well succeed at) fighting regulation and politicizing the underlying debate.\n\nRegulation\n\nElon Musk called for some sort of regulation of AI development as early as 2017. According to NPR, the Tesla CEO is \"clearly not thrilled\" to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believes the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: \"Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there's a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation.\" Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain \"insight\" into the actual status of current research, warning that \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid... [as] they should be.\" In response, politicians express skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development.\n\nResponding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich argues that artificial intelligence is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology. Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself, some scholars suggest to rather develop common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty. Developing well regulated weapons systems is in line with the ethos of some countries' militaries. On October 31, 2019, the United States Department of Defense's (DoD's) Defense Innovation Board published the draft of a report outlining five principles for weaponized AI and making 12 recommendations for the ethical use of artificial intelligence by the DoD that seeks to manage the control problem in all DoD weaponized AI.\n\nRegulation of AGI would likely be influenced by regulation of weaponized or militarized AI, i.e., the AI arms race, the regulation of which is an emerging issue. Any form of regulation will likely be influenced by developments in leading countries' domestic policy towards militarized AI, in the US under the purview of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, and international moves to regulate an AI arms race. Regulation of research into AGI focuses on the role of review boards and encouraging research into safe AI, and the possibility of differential technological progress (prioritizing risk-reducing strategies over risk-taking strategies in AI development) or conducting international mass surveillance to perform AGI arms control. Regulation of conscious AGIs focuses on integrating them with existing human society and can be divided into considerations of their legal standing and of their moral rights. AI arms control will likely require the institutionalization of new international norms embodied in effective technical specifications combined with active monitoring and informal diplomacy by communities of experts, together with a legal and political verification process.\n\nSee also \n AI takeover\n Artificial intelligence arms race\n Effective altruism \u00a7 Long-term future and global catastrophic risks\n Grey goo\n Human Compatible\n Lethal autonomous weapon\nRegulation of algorithms\nRegulation of artificial intelligence\n Robot ethics \u00a7 In popular culture\n Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\nSuffering risks\n System accident\n Technological singularity\nThe Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity\n Paperclip Maximizer\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFuture problems\nHuman extinction\nTechnology hazards\nDoomsday scenarios\nSource 7:\n# International Governance of Civilian AI: A Jurisdictional Certification Approach\n\nRobert F.

This approach represents the extension of a standards, licensing, and liability regime to the global level. We propose that states establish an International AI Organization (IAIO) to certify state jurisdictions (not firms or AI projects) for compliance with international oversight standards. States can give force to these international standards by adopting regulations prohibiting the import of goods whose supply chains embody AI from non-IAIO-certified jurisdictions. This borrows attributes from models of existing international organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). States can also adopt multilateral controls on the export of AI product inputs, such as specialized hardware, to non-certified jurisdictions. Indeed, both the import and export standards could be required for certification. As international actors reach consensus on risks of and minimum standards for advanced AI, a jurisdictional certification regime could mitigate a broad range of potential harms, including threats to public safety.\n\nCorresponding authors: Robert Trager (robert.trager@governance.ai), Ben Harack (ben.harack@gmail.com), Anka Reuel (anka@cs.stanford.edu)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n#### AI Risks Require International Governance\n\nAs automated systems of unprecedented capabilities are developed and deployed, society faces an extraordinary governance challenge, with new risks ranging from algorithmic bias to threats to public safety. Domestic regulation is being developed in states with leading AI capabilities, but domestic regulation is not sufficient.\n\nThe AI industry is deeply international, with supply and product networks spanning many states. While research efforts in a few states are at the forefront, technological understanding of the essential elements of creating frontier systems is becoming more widely dispersed. Though specialized AI-chip supply chains are highly concentrated, access to computing resources is also dispersed. The relatively low computing requirements for using current systems\u2014as opposed to building them\u2014mean that even the most advanced systems can be used by many firms and states around the world that gain access to the trained models. The evolving geographic distribution of AI capabilities is thus uncertain, with global inequities in need of correction, but it is likely that actors in many states will gain access to capabilities sufficient to pose risks of societal harms.\n\nThe potential harms of AI can also cross state borders. Many AI models are accessible online via either API access or an open-source version, which contributes to an immediate global impact. In the future, proprietary systems might be copied against the wishes of their creators. Biological and chemical agents designed by AI technologies could be released far from where they are designed. AI-enabled propaganda or spear phishing campaigns can target people in any country. Competition among firms and states can pressure them into taking greater risks with the technology. These risks and interactions may culminate in catastrophic risks. Indeed, dozens of leading AI scientists have signed a statement that \"mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority\".1\n\nThus, international governance of AI is a global problem in which all have a stake, but presently not all have meaningful representation and input. Regulating AI on a country-by-country basis will likely lead to inadequate regulation in some jurisdictions and fragmented and disjointed regulation in others, hampering needed international collaboration on AI safety and global development. Taking into account the particular characteristics of the AI industry, this report describes trade-offs in the design of international governance of AI and presents one approach to civilian AI 2 governance in detail. We focus on regulating frontier AI, though the approach could be applied more broadly. We define frontier AI as models \"trained on broad data at\n\n<sup>1</sup>Center for AI Safety, \"Statement on AI Risk,\" May 30, 2023, https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk.\n\n<sup>2</sup>Civilian AI refers to all AI except that built under the direct authority of the state for sensitive purposes such as the military or intelligence services.\n\nscale in order to be generally useful across tasks\" (i.e. \"foundation models\") with capabilities sufficient to pose risks to public safety.3\n\n#### Civilian Frontier AI Governance Is Urgently Needed and Feasible\n\nWith most frontier AI development occurring in the private sector, regulating civilian AI is a policy priority, and we expect the serious risks from AI to arise initially in that domain. The international civilian governance problem is urgent because some of the risks described above are present already, and system capabilities and their associated risks are expected to grow rapidly as systems scale and algorithms improve due to large investments in the sector. Military arms control is also desirable, but progress there will be relatively slow and challenging. By contrast, existing models of international civilian regulation appear applicable to civilian frontier AI and compatible with states' interests. Moreover, efforts to govern these different domains can be synergistic, since civilian AI governance can provide a useful testing ground for processes and mechanisms that might eventually be used for governing militaries.\n\n#### A Proposal for an International Governance System for Civilian AI\nSource 8:\n## 3.2 Human Potholes in the Road to TAI\n\nThese insights highlight the necessity of a comprehensive approach to mitigating generative AI misuse, requiring collaboration among policymakers, researchers, industry leaders, and civil society. Addressing this challenge involves not only technical innovations but also a deeper understanding of the social and psychological factors that contribute to the misuse of these powerful technologies, expanding technological countermeasures to generative AI misuses with education and training from the earliest stages of life.\n\n#### 3.2.9 Diluted AI\n\nThe advancement of AI has been so far characterized by a notable lack of a collective goal and thus global coordination, which poses significant challenges for the development of truly TAI. One of the primary issues is the absence of a centralized, international organization dedicated to overseeing and harmonizing AI research, development, and regulation across different nations. This fragmentation results in the duplication of efforts and resources, as various countries and institutions pursue similar AI-related objectives without collaboration or alignment. For instance, multiple countries are investing heavily in AI for defense, healthcare, and economic management, yet their research agendas are often disconnected, leading to inefficiencies and redundancies in innovation. A crucial consequence of this lack of coordination is the allocation of resources to areas that may not represent global priorities for civilization. AI has the potential to address critical global challenges, such as climate change (Ripple et al., 2024), poverty reduction, and public health. However, since national interests often drive research agendas, substantial investments are channeled into projects that serve localized or commercial objectives, rather than addressing global issues. This misalignment of priorities hinders the achievement of TAI, which requires a collective effort to harness the full potential of AI for the benefit of humanity as a whole.\n\nRegrettably, the absence of a unified regulatory framework exacerbates these challenges. While several countries, notably those within the European Union and some states of the United States like California, have begun to implement AI regulations (e.g., the EU AI Act 1 and the AB 3030 2 respectively), these regulations are regional in scope and often reflect specific political, economic, or cultural concerns, despite the unifying and coordinating efforts made by the United Nations3 , the OECD4 , or UNESCO5 . There is no global (planetary) consensus on critical issues such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency, or ethical AI deployment. This regulatory fragmentation can lead to conflicts between nations, as divergent standards for AI safety, ethics, and governance emerge, making it difficult to create interoperable AI systems or enforce shared guidelines.\n\nIn many cases, there are also conflicts of interest at play. Nations and corporations may prioritize AI advancements that give them competitive advantages in global markets or in military applications, rather than fostering the development of AI systems that align with broader humanitarian goals. This competition can lead to \"race-to-the-bottom\" dynamics, where ethical considerations are sacrificed in the rush to achieve technological superiority. Moreover, the lack of coordinated governance mechanisms increases the risk of unequal distribution of AI benefits and widens global inequalities, as wealthier nations dominate the AI landscape while developing countries struggle to access the necessary technologies and expertise, and as demographic advantages creates an imbalance in accessing to talent or having global scientific contributions.\n\nTo overcome these barriers, the development of TAI requires a concerted global effort to align AI research and regulation with long-term societal goals (Coeckelbergh, 2024b). International cooperation, perhaps facilitated by a new multilateral organization similar to the United Nations or the World Health Organization, could ensure that AI advances address pressing global challenges (Ripple et al., 2024), avoid duplication of efforts, and promote equitable access to AI technologies. Without such coordination, the promise of TAI may remain unfulfilled, as fragmented efforts, conflicting interests, and misallocated\n\n<sup>2</sup> https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/29/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-advan ce-safe-and-responsible-ai-protect-californians/?utm_source=chatgpt.com [Accessed on December 10th, 2024].\n\n<sup>3</sup> https://www.un.org/techenvoy/ai-advisory-body [Accessed on December 10th, 2024].\n\n<sup>4</sup> https://oecd.ai/en/ [Accessed on December 10th, 2024].\n\n<sup>5</sup> https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence [Accessed on December 10th, 2024].\n\nresources continue to hinder its development.\n\n#### 3.2.10 Overregulation\n\n## 3.2 Human Potholes in the Road to TAI\n\nDespite having highlighted the need for regulation and unified guidelines at a global level, falling into excess can lead to another problem (Henry et al., 2022). Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are increasingly focused on establishing legal and ethical frameworks to manage the AI deployment and its applications. Although regulation is necessary to mitigate risks and ensure that AI technologies are used ethically and safely, there is a growing concern that overregulation, that is, the imposition of excessive or overly restrictive rules, could significantly hinder progress toward achieving TAI. Overregulation can suppress innovation, slow down technological advancements, and create bureaucratic obstacles that limit the development and deployment of advanced AI systems, as detailed below.\n\n\u2022 Slowing Down Innovation and Research One of the primary consequences of overregulation is the reduction in innovation. Strict regulatory frameworks can require lengthy approval processes, compliance checks, and additional documentation, all of which can delay research and development efforts. Innovators and developers may find themselves spending more time and resources on ensuring compliance than on advancing their technologies. For example, if regulations mandate that every AI system undergoes extensive ethical and safety evaluations before deployment, the time-to-market for new AI models could be significantly increased, thereby hindering the speed at which transformative advancements are realized. Moreover, the fear of regulatory penalties or noncompliance can discourage researchers and companies from pursuing ambitious AI projects, especially in areas that are perceived as high-risk, such as autonomous systems or advanced robotics. When the regulatory environment is overly stringent, it often leads to a riskaverse culture where stakeholders prefer to invest in safer, less innovative projects to avoid potential legal and financial repercussions. This dynamic can prevent the exploration of revolutionary AI advances that are critical for the development of TAI.\n\n\u2022 Fragmentation and Inconsistency Across Jurisdictions Overregulation is also associated with fragmented regulatory landscapes, particularly when different countries or regions impose their own unique sets of rules and guidelines. This lack of harmonization creates a complex environment where companies and researchers must navigate a patchwork of regulations, often facing conflicting requirements depending on the jurisdiction in which they operate. For instance, while the EU AI Act can emphasize strict ethical compliance and privacy standards such as in video surveillance, other regions like the United States or China may adopt different approaches focusing on innovation and market competitiveness. Such discrepancies make it challenging for AI developers to create solutions that comply with multiple regulatory regimes simultaneously, leading to inefficiencies and duplication of efforts. This fragmentation limits the scalability of AI solutions and hampers international collaboration. The development of TAI requires a global effort, with research teams and industries across borders working together toward aligned goals. However, when regulatory systems are incompatible, they inhibit the exchange of knowledge, technology, and data. Consequently, this global disconnection undermines the collaborative efforts necessary to achieve the full potential of TAI.\n\n\u2022 Bureaucratic Barriers and Compliance Costs An environment characterized by overregulation inevitably results in increased compliance costs and bureaucratic barriers. For startups and smaller AI firms, the financial burden of meeting regulatory requirements can be prohibitive, preventing them from entering the market or scaling their technologies. This is particularly concerning, as many groundbreaking innovations often emerge from smaller entities that lack the resources of large corporations. If overregulation continues to dominate the AI landscape, the field may become dominated by a few large firms capable of absorbing the compliance costs, reducing diversity and competition in AI development (if this has not already happened). Additionally, the bureaucratic hurdles associated with overregulation can create an uneven playing field where only the most well-funded companies or those with legal expertise can thrive. This dynamic suppresses innovation and contributes to the concentration of power within a limited number of organizations, potentially undermining the democratic and open nature of AI development. Such concentration of resources and influence is likely to have a negative impact on the development of TAI, as fewer perspectives and ideas are represented in the process.\nSource 9:\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) involves developing public policies and laws to promote and manage AI, addressing both its potential and risks. This issue is emerging globally, with significant efforts in the European Union, China, the United States, and other nations. Since 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published to maintain social control over the technology. Notable figures like Elon Musk have advocated for regulation, while others, like Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, argue it is premature. The OECD, IEEE, and UNESCO are among the bodies working on global AI governance. Regional and national strategies vary, with the EU focusing on high-risk AI applications and the UK emphasizing long-term risks. The United States has taken a cautious approach, balancing innovation with safety. Lethal autonomous weapons (LAWS) also face international scrutiny, with discussions ongoing at the UN. The regulation of AI is crucial to ensure its development aligns with human values and societal needs.\n\nThe chunk is: The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally, including in the European Union and in supra-national bodies like the IEEE, OECD and others. Since 2016, a wave of AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks. Regulation of AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.\n\nBackground \nIn 2017 Elon Musk called for regulation of AI development. According to NPR, the Tesla CEO was \"clearly not thrilled\" to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believed the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: \"Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there's a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilization.\" In response, some politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that is still in development. Responding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has argued that AI is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology. Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself, some scholars suggested developing common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty.\n\nPerspectives \nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI. Regulation is now generally considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks. Public administration and policy considerations generally focus on the technical and economic implications and on trustworthy and human-centered AI systems, although regulation of artificial superintelligences is also considered. The basic approach to regulation focuses on the risks and biases of AI's underlying technology, i.e., machine-learning algorithms, at the level of the input data, algorithm testing, and the decision model, as well as whether explanations of biases in the code can be understandable for prospective recipients of the technology, and technically feasible for producers to convey.\n\nAI regulation could derive from basic principles. A 2020 Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society meta-review of existing sets of principles, such as the Asilomar Principles and the Beijing Principles, identified eights such basic principles: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and respect for human values. AI law and regulations have been divided into three main topics, namely governance of autonomous intelligence systems, responsibility and accountability for the systems, and privacy and safety issues. A public administration approach sees a relationship between AI law and regulation, the ethics of AI, and 'AI society', defined as workforce substitution and transformation, social acceptance and trust in AI, and the transformation of human to machine interaction. The development of public sector strategies for management and regulation of AI is deemed necessary at the local, national, and international levels and in a variety of fields, from public service management and accountability to law enforcement, healthcare (especially the concept of a Human Guarantee), the financial sector, robotics, autonomous vehicles, the military and national security, and international law.\n\nHenry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published an joint statement in November 2021 entitled \"Being Human in an Age of AI\", calling for a government commission to regulate AI.\n\nAs a response to the AI control problem\n\nRegulation of AI can be seen as positive social means to manage the AI control problem, i.e., the need to insure long-term beneficial AI, with other social responses such as doing nothing or banning being seen as impractical, and approaches such as enhancing human capabilities through transhumanism approaches such as brain-computer interfaces being seen as potentially complementary. Regulation of research into artificial general intelligence (AGI) focuses on the role of review boards, from university or corporation to international levels, and on encouraging research into safe AI, together with the possibility of differential intellectual progress (prioritizing risk-reducing strategies over risk-taking strategies in AI development) or conducting international mass surveillance to perform AGI arms control. For instance, the 'AGI Nanny' is a proposed strategy, potentially under the control of humanity, for preventing the creation of a dangerous superintelligence as well as addressing other major threats to human well-being, such as subversion of the global financial system, until a superintelligence can be safely created. It entails the creation of a smarter-than-human, but not superintelligent, artificial general intelligence system connected to a large surveillance network, with the goal of monitoring humanity and protecting it from danger.\" Regulation of conscious, ethically aware AGIs focuses on integrating them with existing human society and can be divided into considerations of their legal standing and of their moral rights. Regulation of AI has been seen as restrictive, with a risk of preventing the development of AGI.\n\nGlobal guidance \nThe development of a global governance board to regulate AI development was suggested at least as early as 2017. In December 2018, Canada and France announced plans for a G7-backed International Panel on Artificial Intelligence, modeled on the International Panel on Climate Change, to study the global effects of AI on people and economies and to steer AI development. In 2019, the Panel was renamed the Global Partnership on AI.\n\nThe Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology, as outlined in the OECD Principles on Artificial Intelligence (2019). The founding members of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence are Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Rep. Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, the USA and the UK. The GPAI Secretariat is hosted by the OECD in Paris, France. GPAI\u2019s mandate covers four themes, two of which are supported by the International Centre of Expertise in Montr\u00e9al for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, namely, responsible AI and data governance. A corresponding centre of excellence in Paris, yet to be identified, will support the other two themes on the future of work and innovation, and commercialization. GPAI will also investigate how AI can be leveraged to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe OECD Recommendations on AI were adopted in May 2019, and the G20 AI Principles in June 2019. In September 2019 the World Economic Forum issued ten 'AI Government Procurement Guidelines'. In February 2020, the European Union published its draft strategy paper for promoting and regulating AI.\nSource 10:\n# **10 Governance**\n\nInternational cooperation on AI regulation is hence desirable but fraught with challenges. These include differences in values, governance structures, and levels of AI maturity among countries. The U.S. and European nations often prioritize transparency, fairness, and individual privacy, while other countries may focus on safety concerns (Meltzer & Kerry, 2021). Additionally, existing international forums for AI governance, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) and the OECD's AI Principles, have made progress but lack enforcement mechanisms and broad participation (Zhang et al., 2022).\n\nAnother challenge for AI regulation cooperation lies in the competing economic interests of countries. AI is seen as a strategic asset, and there is growing concern about a zerosum competition between the U.S. and China, where AI capabilities are tied to national security and economic dominance (Meltzer & Kerry, 2021). This competition could hinder efforts to establish collaborative regulatory frameworks, as countries may prioritize their own competitive advantages over global safety concerns (Barker, 2023).\n\nGiven these challenges, a flexible, multi-tiered framework for international AI regulation is the global desideratum. This framework should operate through a combination of binding international agreements and voluntary, non-binding standards that can adapt to regional and sectoral differences. Drawing from previous research, we identify key components for such a framework:\n\n- **Global AI Risk Taxonomy**: A global AI risk taxonomy, akin to the one proposed in this survey, could provide a unified language for discussing AI risks across sectors and countries. This taxonomy would categorize risks into different levels, focusing on critical areas such as data privacy, bias, and misuse. By standardizing how risks are understood and communicated, international actors can more easily align on policy priorities.\n- **International AI Standards**: Building on existing initiatives, international standards could be developed under the auspices of a global body such as the United Nations or the World Trade Organization. These standards would focus on ensuring AI systems' transparency, accountability, and fairness. A global AI council could be established to oversee compliance with these standards, with mechanisms for voluntary reporting and peer review (Zhang et al., 2022).\n- **Data Governance and Privacy**: One of the most critical areas for cooperation is data governance, given the central role of data in AI development. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe provides a template for robust data protection, but international frameworks are needed to manage cross-border data flows and prevent abuses, particularly in countries with weaker regulatory environments (Barker, 2023). This could involve multilateral agreements on data-sharing protocols and privacy standards, facilitated by international organizations.\n- **Ethics and Human Rights**: AI governance must be grounded in universal ethical principles and human rights. This includes ensuring that AI technologies do not exacer-\n\nbate existing inequalities or infringe on human rights. The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI is a step in this direction, but further cooperation is required to ensure that these principles are embedded in national laws and international agreements (Meltzer & Kerry, 2021).\n\n- **Technological Sovereignty and National Security**: To address concerns about the geopolitical implications of AI, international treaties should balance technological sovereignty with security cooperation. This would ensure that AI technologies with potential military applications are subject to export controls and international oversight (Zhang et al., 2022).\nIn conclusion, as AI technology continues to evolve, the need for international cooperation in its regulation becomes more urgent. National regulations, while necessary, are insufficient to manage the global risks posed by AI. An international framework that promotes cooperation, harmonizes standards, and balances innovation with safety is essential. Drawing on existing regulatory efforts and risk taxonomies, we propose a flexible, multi-tiered framework with identified key components to AI governance, one that can adapt to the diverse needs and priorities of different countries while ensuring the responsible development of AI.\n\nBy fostering dialogue and cooperation between governments, private sectors, and civil society, the international community can harness the potential of AI while mitigating its risks. The road ahead is challenging, but with a coordinated global effort, AI can be developed in a way that benefits humanity as a whole.\n\n# **10.1.2 Technical Oversight Proposals**\n\nTechnical oversight has emerged as a key mechanism for mitigating AI risks, focusing on auditing, monitoring, and ensuring the accountability of AI systems (Turchin & Denkenberger, 2020; NAIAC, 2023). The rapid adoption of AI technologies across industries requires an agile and comprehensive regulatory approach, particularly as AI systems often operate in opaque, complex ways that can escape traditional regulatory scrutiny (Bommasani et al., 2024a).\n\nWhile much has been discussed on ethical AI and responsible innovation, the technical aspects of oversight remain underexplored. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a detailed analysis of technical oversight proposals in AI regulation. It draws from recent literature, including contributions from industry and academia, to offer a broad understanding of the regulatory landscape (Bengio et al., 2024b). The focus will be on the practical implementation of oversight mechanisms that ensure AI systems are safe, accountable, and transparent throughout their lifecycle.\n\nTechnical oversight in AI regulation involves a variety of components that ensure AI systems adhere to ethical and safety standards. These components include transparency and explainability, auditing and monitoring, accountability mechanisms, and the establishment of safety standards and certification processes.\n\n- **Transparency and Explainability**: Transparency is a cornerstone of responsible AI governance. For AI systems to be effectively regulated, their decision-making\nprocesses must be interpretable by human operators and auditors (Bengio et al., 2024b; Bommasani et al., 2024b). Explainability refers to the ability to trace and understand how an AI system arrives at its conclusions. This is particularly important in highstakes fields such as healthcare and criminal justice, where opaque decision-making can lead to harmful consequences. The push for transparency aligns with regulatory frameworks, such as the European Union's GDPR, which mandates that individuals have the right to an explanation of AI-driven decisions (Bommasani et al., 2024a).\n\n- **Auditing and Monitoring**: The auditing of AI systems is essential for identifying potential biases, operational flaws, or security vulnerabilities. AI audits can be performed at various stages of system development, from pre-deployment assessments to continuous monitoring once AI systems are in operation (Bengio et al., 2024b; Bommasani et al., 2024b). Continuous monitoring ensures that AI systems remain compliant with ethical guidelines and legal requirements over time. Monitoring frameworks should include mechanisms for tracking data quality, decision-making processes, and model performance, especially in dynamic environments where AI models learn and adapt (Bengio et al., 2024b).\n- **Accountability Mechanisms**: Accountability ensures that developers and operators of AI systems are responsible for the outcomes produced by their technologies. One of the major proposals in this area is the introduction of mandatory incident reporting for high-risk AI applications (Bengio et al., 2024b). This would require companies and organizations to disclose failures or unethical outcomes produced by their AI systems. Additionally, clear guidelines must be established to define liability in cases where AI systems cause harm, particularly in scenarios where the harm could have been anticipated or prevented through proper oversight (Bommasani et al., 2024a).\n- **Safety Standards and Certification**: The development of safety standards and certification processes for AI systems is a critical element of technical oversight. These standards should be based on international cooperation to ensure harmonized regulatory approaches across different jurisdictions. Certification processes would involve third-party assessments to verify that AI systems meet established safety and ethical benchmarks before they are deployed in critical settings (Bommasani et al., 2024a). Such standards should cover aspects like data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and robustness against adversarial attacks (Bengio et al., 2024b; Bommasani et al., 2024b).\n\nDespite the clear need for technical oversight, several challenges complicate its implementation. The rapid pace of AI development is perhaps the most significant challenge, as regulatory bodies often struggle to keep up with the latest advancements in AI technologies (Bengio et al., 2024b). Additionally, the complexity of many AI systems, particularly deep learning models, makes it difficult to audit and monitor their operations effectively. These models often function as \"black boxes\", where even the developers may not fully understand the intricacies of their decision-making processes (Bommasani et al., 2024a)."

      "response_tokens": 1378,
      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to combine integrated information theory (IIT) and predictive processing to understand consciousness emergence in artificial neural networks. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, let me recall what IIT is all about. From what I remember, IIT looks at the idea that consciousness arises from the integration of information-processing activity within a system, especially as it relates to its ability to compress information. So, if a system can maintain precise representations of its own state across time and space, that's considered integrated information.\n\nThen there's predictive processing. I think this theory is about how networks of neurons learn by making predictions about their inputs. If the network can predict effectively, it must have organized itself in a way that allows for such predictions\u2014maybe through structured patterns or feedback loops.\n\nNow, combining these two concepts... How can they interact? Well, consciousness emergence is when something starts to feel real or self-aware beyond its biological function. In neural networks, this might mean the network becomes capable of representing and predicting its own state in a way that's hard to replicate by other systems.\n\nSo, maybe IIT's focus on integration of information with predictive processing's ability to make predictions can be tied together. I could think about how an artificial neural network, structured in a certain way, might integrate information (as per IIT) and also predict its own activity (as per predictive processing). The emergence of consciousness would then be when this system shows these properties at a higher level, beyond the individual neurons.\n\nI should probably define what exactly constitutes integrated information. Maybe it's something like the amount of new information that a system captures about itself from outside inputs over time and space. Then, how does predictive processing fit into this? It might involve mechanisms where the network learns to predict external events by adjusting its internal representations.\n\nMaybe I can model this with some equations or parameters. For example, in IIT, the integrated information index \u03a6 is calculated based on the amount of compression achieved in representing states. So, higher \u03a6 means more integrated information. In predictive processing, perhaps the strength of the prediction is measured by how well the network can predict its inputs before they occur.\n\nWhen combining these, the idea might be that a neural network with high \u03a6 and strong predictive capabilities (high strength) would exhibit consciousness emergence. I need to think about what metrics from each theory could be merged or adjusted together in an artificial setting.\n\nI also wonder how this applies beyond our brains. Can an artificial system demonstrate these principles? Maybe by designing networks that have both high integrated information and good prediction abilities, and then testing if they exhibit consciousness-like properties in terms of emergent behavior.\n\nWait, but the question is about mathematical frameworks. So, perhaps I should define some variables or functions from each theory and see how they integrate. For example, from IIT, \u03a6 is a function of the system's state compression across time. From predictive processing, maybe there's a measure like prediction strength, which could be related to how well the network predicts external inputs.\n\nWhen combining them, perhaps the consciousness emergence index would have both components: one based on integrated information and another based on predictive processing capability. Then, using these two metrics together to assess consciousness in artificial networks.\n\nI should also consider whether there are any existing models or theories that bridge these concepts. I think there's some work where neural networks are used to model consciousness, but it's more empirical rather than purely theoretical. Still, combining IIT and predictive processing might offer a framework for understanding emergence in those models.\n\nMaybe I can outline the steps: first define integrated information \u03a6 using state compression, then define prediction strength based on how well external inputs are predicted by the network. Then create a composite measure that combines both to assess consciousness emergence in varying architectures.\n\nI should also consider how different neural structures would affect these metrics. For example, networks with more layers or feedback might have higher integrated information but perhaps lower prediction strength because they're harder to predict if their structure isn't well-regulated. Or vice versa.\n\nIn terms of equations, I'll need to set up variables for state space compression in IIT and the predictive error or likelihood in predictive processing. Then, develop a formula that sums these two aspects or multiplies them somehow to get the consciousness index.\n\nI think it's important to note how this approach would scale with different network architectures. Maybe by varying parameters like learning rate, network depth, or architectural complexity, we can observe how \u03a6 and prediction strength change, thus understanding which factors contribute most to consciousness emergence in each case.\n\nOverall, combining IIT's info-processing theory with predictive processing's learning mechanisms seems promising. It provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how complex systems like artificial neural networks might exhibit consciousness at higher levels beyond their biological functions.\n</think>\n\nTo combine integrated information theory (IIT) and predictive processing to study consciousness emergence in artificial neural networks, we can develop a framework that integrates both theoretical frameworks. Here's an organized approach:\n\n1. **Define Integrated Information \u03a6 from IIT**:\n   - \u03a6 measures the amount of integration or compression a system achieves by maintaining precise representations of its state across time and space.\n   - Use metrics like state space compression to quantify \u03a6, indicating how well the system captures information about itself.\n\n2. **Predictive Processing Metrics**:\n   - Predictive processing involves networks learning by making predictions about external inputs.\n   - Measure prediction strength based on how accurately the network can predict inputs before they occur, often using likelihood or error metrics.\n\n3. **Composite Consciousness Index**:\n   - Combine \u03a6 and prediction strength into a consciousness emergence index that reflects both integration (IIT) and predictive capability (predictive processing).\n   - This composite measure assesses whether an artificial network exhibits consciousness by capturing both its internal integration and ability to predict external information.\n\n4. **Architectural Considerations**:\n   - Different neural architectures affect these metrics differently.\n   - Networks with higher depth or feedback might have higher \u03a6 but lower prediction strength, as they are harder to predict without adequate regulation.\n   - Conversely, shallower networks may better predict inputs but lack deep integration.\n\n5. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - Define \u03a6 using information theory metrics from IIT.\n   - Define prediction strength with likelihood or error-based measures from predictive processing.\n   - Combine these into a formula that captures both aspects for the consciousness index.\n\n6. **Empirical Validation and Application**:\n   - Test this framework on various neural structures to observe how architectures influence consciousness emergence.\n   - Compare results across different networks to understand factors contributing to consciousness emergence in artificial systems.\n\nThis approach provides a theoretical foundation for understanding consciousness emergence in artificial neural networks by integrating IIT's info-processing theory with predictive processing' learning mechanisms."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this paper about reservoir computing and emergence. From what I gather, they're talking about how biological systems, especially the brain, have some kind of integration or binding between different parts that we don't quite get at a single neuron level. The paper mentions something called partial information decomposition (PID) and emergence.\n\nFirst, I need to wrap my head around emergence. I think emergence is when complex phenomena appear in systems whose components are simpler than those phenomena. Like how a tree emerges from the growth of its roots. In this context, it's about how groups of neurons or data points give us information that's not just additive but perhaps combines parts in non-trivial ways.\n\nThen there's partial information decomposition (PID). I remember PID is a way to break down mutual information into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. That makes sense because when two pieces of information work together beyond what either gives alone, it's synergy. Unique info is what's only from one piece, redundancy is shared by both, and synergy is the combined effect.\n\nThe paper talks about how these concepts can help understand emergence in computational systems like reservoir computers. So, maybe if we apply PID to the outputs of a reservoir computer, we can figure out which parts contribute uniquely, redundantly, or synergistically. That could show us what's causing the overall computation and how it emerges from simpler components.\n\nThe authors mention examples with X1 and X2 in an example about animals eating seasonal harvests. In that case, X1 found beak info and hiding, while X2 saw something about swimming in the pond and being furry. The identity of Y is determined by both. So similar to emergence, where parts work together.\n\nApplying this idea to reservoir computing's outputs would mean looking at how each part (inputs) contributes uniquely, redundantly, or synergistically to the output. This might help us understand what features in the input lead to specific patterns in the output that emerge from the system as a whole.\n\nI'm also thinking about how this connects to the idea of binding problem mentioned earlier. The system has higher-level phenomena (like Y being a certain animal) that aren't just at the neuron level but emerge from the interaction of groups. By using PID and emergence, we can better grasp how these interactions lead to higher-level understanding.\n\nI wonder if this has any implications for machine learning or reservoir computing. If we model neural networks with emergence principles, maybe we can better understand why they process information in certain ways without relying solely on individual neuron activities. It might help explain the effectiveness of deep learning by showing that it's not just adding up features but also combining them synergistically.\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the practical applications. How would quantifying emergence and using PID in reservoir computing aid in real-world systems? Maybe in neuroscience to better understand how higher-order brain functions emerge from lower-level processes or in materials science for designing systems that exhibit collective behavior through synergy.\n\nI think the key takeaway is that while individual neurons have limited processing power, their interactions and nonlinearities lead to complex computations. By applying emergence and PID, we can peel back these layers of complexity to find underlying principles that govern the system's functioning. This could provide new tools for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in various fields.\n</think>\n\nThe paper explores the concept of emergence and partial information decomposition (PID) within reservoir computing, aiming to understand how complex computations emerge from the interactions of simpler components. Here's a structured summary:\n\n1. **Emergence**: \n   - Emergence refers to the phenomenon where higher-level phenomena appear more than the sum of their parts. For example, a bird emerges from the interaction of its beak and feathers.\n   \n2. **Partial Information Decomposition (PID)**:\n   - PID breaks down mutual information into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. This helps identify how information contributes uniquely to computation, redundantly shared by multiple inputs, or combines through synergy.\n\n3. **Application in Reservoir Computing**:\n   - Reservoir computers are used as computational models, where reservoirs (fixed recurrent neural networks) project input into high-dimensional spaces.\n   - Applying PID to their outputs reveals the unique, redundant, and synergistic contributions of inputs. This identifies which parts contribute uniquely, redundantly share information, or work together synergistically for higher-level outcomes.\n\n4. **Example from the Binding Problem**:\n   - The animal example illustrates emergence: while X1 finds beak info and hides, X2 sees swimming in a pond and is furry. Y (the animal) emerges as a platypus due to both components working synergistically.\n\n5. **Implications for Machine Learning and Reservoir Computing**:\n   - By modeling reservoir computers with emergence principles, we can better understand how higher-level phenomena emerge from lower-level interactions. This could aid in explaining deep learning effectiveness by considering synergy over additive features.\n   - This approach might offer new tools for neuroscience to understand brain function's binding problem and materials science for designing collective systems.\n\n6. **Future Applications**:\n   - The principles could help in both theoretical understanding and practical applications, such as in optimizing algorithms or designing neural networks, providing insights into how complex computations arise from simpler components.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper uses emergence and PID to understand how higher-level phenomena emerge from lower-level interactions, offering new perspectives on reservoir computing and its broader implications.",
      "context": "Source 1:\nFront. Artif. Intell., 09 June 2020\nSec. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\nThis article is part of the Research TopicProbabilistic perspectives on brain (dys)functionView all 11 articles\nThe Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI) begins with the understanding that persisting systems must regulate environmental exchanges and prevent entropic accumulation. In FEP-AI, minds and brains are predictive controllers for autonomous systems, where action-driven perception is realized as probabilistic inference. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with considering the preconditions for a system to intrinsically exist, as well as axioms regarding the nature of consciousness. IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement turbo coding via loopy message-passing over predictive (autoencoding) networks, thus generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, thus affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, thus enabling inferential synergy.\nHere, I introduceIntegrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT)as a synthetic approach to understanding consciousness, using theFree Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI)(Friston et al., 2006,2017a;Friston, 2010) to combine multiple theories into a unified perspective. IWMT focuses onIntegrated Information Theory (IIT)(Tononi, 2004;Tononi et al., 2016) andGlobal Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT)(Baars, 1993;Dehaene, 2014) as two of the most well-known theories of consciousness. Areas of agreement and disagreement between IIT and GNWT will be explored, as well as the extent to which points of contention might be productively addressed by situating these theories within FEP-AI. I then review the fundamentals of FEP-AI as a general systems theory, including points of intersection with IIT as an account of causal emergence. I then go on to discuss mechanistic and computational principles by which these theories can all be integrated using IWMT. In brief, IWMT states that consciousness may be what it is like to be processes capable of generating integrated models of systems and worlds with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence. IWMT further suggests that such coherence is only likely to be attainable for embodied agentic systems with controllers capable of supporting complexes of high degrees of integrated information, functioning as global workspaces and arenas for Bayesian model selection. Finally, I consider potential implications of these proposals with respect to the enduring problems of consciousness and artificial intelligence.\nHow can physical systems generate subjective experiences? Can mental states function as causes, or are we mere automata? These perennial questions may finally be answerable with two unifying frameworks for understanding complex systems and minds: FEP-AI and IIT. These two meta-theoretical frameworks were developed in the context of understanding psychological and neurobiological phenomena, yet their implications are far more extensive. FEP-AI may be the first unified formalism and paradigm for the mind and life sciences, and IIT is one of the most widely known and technically detailed models of consciousness and informational synergy. FEP-AI describes what systems must be like in order to persist, and IIT describes what it means for systems to intrinsically exist as systems. Both FEP-AI and IIT constitute general systems theories with scopes transcending disciplinary boundaries, having relevance not only for the philosophy and science of mind but also for understanding all emergent complexity.\nHierarchical predictive processing (HPP)offers powerfully explanatory implementational and algorithmic details for active inference (Clark, 2016), providing a single mechanism for both perception and action. FEP-AI further emphasizes the roles of embodiment, selfhood, and agency in minimizing free energy via action\u2013perception cycles, thus naturally supporting bridges to phenomenology on multiple levels. While probabilistic modeling may narrow explanatory gaps between brain and mind, the question remains: how do (seemingly definite) subjective experiences emerge from probabilities?\nIIT begins from phenomenology (Tononi, 2004), observing that consciousness is distinct in its particular details (i.e., information), while also being experienced holistically (i.e., integration). This observation generated the hypothesis that consciousness results from the ability of nervous systems to support diverse state repertoires, while also synergistically integrating this information into wholes greater than the sum of their parts. IIT further suggests that this capacity for generating integrated information can be quantified by analyzing the degree to which systems are irreducible to the information contained in their parts considered separately. IIT has developed through multiple iterations, most recently formalized with phenomenological axioms and the postulated properties required for realizing these aspects of experience in physical systems (Tononi et al., 2016). These postulates are stipulated to be not onlynecessary, but also, controversially (Bayne, 2018;Lau and Michel, 2019),jointly sufficientconditions for conscious experience (Table 2).\nTable 2. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) axioms and postulates, with corresponding examples of experiences and mechanistic systems.\nIIT is both a theory of consciousness and meta-physical formalism, attempting to answer the question: what counts as a system from an intrinsic perspective (Fallon, 2018)? IIT models systems as networks of causal relations, evaluating compositional structures for their ability to inform (or constrain) past and future states.Integrated information (phi)is calculated based on the degree to which cutting systems along aminimum information partition (MIP)impact past and future self-information, evaluated across all relevant spatial and temporal grains for system evolution. The extent to which MIPs reduce self-information is used to calculate the degree to which systems make irreducible (i.e., integrated) causal differences to themselves, thus defining their integrated information (quantified as phi). Intuitively, if something can be decomposed into parts without consequence, then it is not an integrated system. According to the exclusion axiom, systems are only real (and potentially conscious) if they represent maxima of integrated information. The self-directed causal relation of a maximal complex is referred to as amaximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS)\u2014corresponding to mappings onto an abstract metric space (i.e., \u201cqualia space\u201d) (Balduzzi and Tononi, 2009), whose particular geometries correspond to particular experiences. Further, sub-mechanisms contributing given MICS will be associated with a variety of phenomenal distinctions, specified asmaximally irreducible cause-effect (MICE) repertories.\nWhile IIT's experience-first approach provides compelling bridges between phenomenology and mechanistic implementations, the question remains: why should there be \u201canything that it is like\u201d to be a maximally irreducible cause-effect structure? As described below, IWMT proposes that a maximal complex (entailing a MICS) could also entail subjective experience,if (and only if)these complexes also entail probabilistic mappings\u2014or maximal a posteriori (MAP) estimates derived thereof\u2014entailed by generative models for the sensoriums of embodied\u2013embedded goal-seeking agents. As described in further detail below, IWMT further proposes that phi parameterizes the ability of systems to minimize free energy and maximize self-model evidence. While the most valid means of defining integrated information for conscious (or unconscious) systems remains contested (Barrett and Mediano, 2019), one potential advance from IWMT's proposed synthesis could be identifying the appropriate uses for various formulations of integrative complexity.\nThe putative sufficiency of IIT's phenomenological postulates for consciousness results in a surprising implication: the degree to which systems exist is also the degree to which they generate conscious experience (Tononi and Koch, 2015). As will be described in greater detail below, IWMT accepts a modified version of this proposition with fewer protopansychist implications: systems exist to the degree they generate model evidence for themselves, which may entail consciousness if models have spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for systems and world. Below, I describe how systems might be configured if they are to generate complexes of integrated information with these coherence-enabling properties.\n[Note: A more detailed discussion of IIT's postulates and axioms can be found in IWMT Revisited (Safron,2019a), in the section: \u201cA review of IIT terminology.\u201d]\nOriginally introduced byBaars (1993), Global Workspace Theory considers computational requirements for intelligent functioning, drawing analogies between consciousness and computing architectures in which \u201cblackboards\u201d share information among multiple specialist processes. According to Baars, consciousness is hypothesized to correspond to a \u201cglobal workspace\u201d that allows unconscious segregated processes to communicate with informational synergy. Information becomes conscious when it enters workspaces, and so can be effectively broadcast throughout entire systems. Because of workspaces' limited capacities, specialist processes compete\nSource 2:\nIntegrated information theory(IIT) proposes a mathematical model for theconsciousnessof a system. It comprises a framework ultimately intended to explain why some physical systems (such ashuman brains) are conscious,[1]and to be capable of providing a concrete inference about whether any physical system is conscious, to what degree, and what particular experience it has; why they feel the particular way they do in particular states (e.g. why our visual field appears extended when we gaze out at the night sky),[2]and what it would take for other physical systems to be conscious (Are other animals conscious?Might the whole universe be?).[3]\nAccording to IIT, a system's consciousness (what it is like subjectively) is conjectured to beidenticalto itscausalproperties (what it is like objectively). Therefore, it should be possible to account for the conscious experience of a physical system by unfolding its complete causal powers.[4]\nIIT was proposed by neuroscientistGiulio Tononiin 2004.[5]Despite significant interest, IIT remains controversial and has been widely criticized, including that it isunfalsifiablepseudoscience.[6]\nDavid Chalmershas argued that any attempt to explain consciousness in purely physical terms (i.e., to start with the laws of physics as they are currently formulated and derive the necessary and inevitable existence of consciousness) eventually runs into the so-called \"hard problem\". Rather than try to start from physical principles and arrive at consciousness, IIT \"starts with consciousness\" (accepts the existence of our own consciousness as certain) and reasons about the properties that a postulated physical substrate would need to have in order to account for it. The ability to perform this jump fromphenomenologyto mechanism rests on IIT's assumption that if the formal properties of a conscious experience can be fully accounted for by an underlying physical system, then the properties of the physical system must be constrained by the properties of the experience. The limitations on the physical system for consciousness to exist are unknown and consciousness may exist on a spectrum, as implied by studies involving split-brain patients[7]and conscious patients with large amounts of brain matter missing.[8]\nSpecifically, IIT moves from phenomenology to mechanism by attempting to identify the essential properties of conscious experience (dubbed \"axioms\") and, from there, the essential properties of conscious physical systems (dubbed \"postulates\").\nThe calculation of even a modestly-sized system's\u03a6Max{\\displaystyle \\Phi ^{\\textrm {Max}}}is often computationally intractable,[9]so efforts have been made to develop heuristic or proxy measures of integrated information. For example, Masafumi Oizumi and colleagues have developed both\u03a6\u2217{\\displaystyle \\Phi ^{*}}[10]and geometric integrated information or\u03a6G{\\displaystyle \\Phi ^{G}},[11]which are practical approximations for integrated information. These are related to proxy measures developed earlier byAnil Sethand Adam Barrett.[12]However, none of these proxy measures have a mathematically proven relationship to the actual\u03a6Max{\\displaystyle \\Phi ^{\\textrm {Max}}}value, which complicates the interpretation of analyses that use them. They can give qualitatively different results even for very small systems.[13]\nIn 2021, Angus Leung and colleagues published a direct application of IIT's mathematical formalism to neural data.[14]To circumvent the computational challenges associated with larger datasets, the authors focused on neuronal population activity in the fly. The study showed that\u03a6Max{\\displaystyle \\Phi ^{\\textrm {Max}}}can readily be computed for smaller sets of neural data. Moreover, matching IIT's predictions,\u03a6Max{\\displaystyle \\Phi ^{\\textrm {Max}}}was significantly decreased when the animals underwent general anesthesia.[14]\nIn 2019, theTempleton Foundationannounced funding in excess of $6,000,000 to test opposing empirical predictions of IIT and a rival theory (Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, GNWT).[29][30]The originators of both theories signed off on experimental protocols and data analyses as well as the exact conditions that satisfy if their championed theory correctly predicted the outcome or not.[31][32]Initial results were revealed in June 2023.[33]None of GNWT's predictions passed what was agreed upon pre-registration while two out of three of IIT's predictions passed that threshold.[34]\nInfluential philosopherJohn Searlehas given a critique of theory saying \"The theory impliespanpsychism\" and \"The problem with panpsychism is not that it is false; it does not get up to the level of being false. It is strictly speaking meaningless because no clear notion has been given to the claim.\"[35]However, whether or not a theory has panpsychist implications (that all or most of what exists physically must be, be part of something that is, or be composed of parts that are, conscious) has no bearing on the scientific validity of the theory. Searle's take has also been countered by other philosophers, for misunderstanding and misrepresenting a theory that is actually resonant with his own ideas.[36]\nTheoretical computer scientistScott Aaronsonhas criticized IIT by demonstrating through its own formulation that an inactive series oflogic gates, arranged in the correct way, would not only be conscious but be \"unboundedly more conscious than humans are.\"[37]Tononi himself agrees with the assessment and argues that according to IIT, an even simpler arrangement of inactive logic gates, if large enough, would also be conscious. However he further argues that this is a strength of IIT rather than a weakness, because that's exactly the sort ofcytoarchitecturefollowed by large portions of thecerebral cortex,[38][39]specially at the back of the brain,[2]which is the most likely neuroanatomicalcorrelate of consciousnessaccording to some reviews.[40]\nPhilosopher Tim Bayne has criticized the axiomatic foundations of the theory.[41]He concludes that \"the so-called 'axioms' that Tononi et al. appeal to fail to qualify as genuine axioms\".\nIIT as a scientific theory of consciousness has been criticized in the scientific literature as only able to be \"either false or unscientific\" by its own definitions.[42]IIT has also been denounced by other members of the consciousness field as requiring \"an unscientific leap of faith\", but it is not clear that this is in fact the case if the theory is properly understood.[43]The theory has also been derided for failing to answer the basic questions required of a theory of consciousness. Philosopher Adam Pautz says \"As long as proponents of IIT do not address these questions, they have not put a clear theory on the table that can be evaluated as true or false.\"[44]NeuroscientistMichael Graziano, proponent of the competingattention schema theory, rejects IIT aspseudoscience. He claims IIT is a \"magicalist theory\" that has \"no chance of scientific success or understanding\".[45]Similarly, IIT was criticized that its claims are \"not scientifically established or testable at the moment\".[46]\nHowever, while it is true that the complete analysis suggested by IIT cannot be completed at the moment for human brains, IIT has already been applied to models of visual cortex to explain why visual space feels the way it does.[2]\nNeuroscientistsBj\u00f6rn Merker, David Rudrauf and Philosopher Kenneth Williford co-authored a paper criticizing IIT on several grounds. Firstly, by not demonstrating that all members of systems which do in fact combine integration and differentiation in the formal IIT sense are conscious, systems which demonstrate high levels of integration and differentiation of information might provide the necessary conditions for consciousness but those combinations of attributes do not amount to the conditions for consciousness. Secondly that the measure, \u03a6, reflects efficiency of global information transfer rather than level of consciousness, and that the correlation of \u03a6 with level of consciousness through different states of wakefulness (e.g. awake, dreaming and dreamless sleep, anesthesia, seizures and coma) actually reflect the level of efficient network interactions performed for cortical engagement. Hence \u03a6 reflects network efficiency rather than consciousness, which would be one of the functions served by cortical network efficiency.[47]\nA letter published on 15 September 2023 in the preprint repositoryPsyArXivand signed by 124 scholars asserted that until IIT is empirically testable, it should be labeled pseudoscience.[48]A number of researchers defended the theory in response.[6]Computer scientist Hector Zenil based his criticism of IIT and what he considers a similarly unscientific theory,Assembly theory(AT), on the lack of correspondence of the methods and theory in some IIT research papers and the media frenzy.[49]He criticized the shallowness and misleading nature of the media coverage, including that which appeared in journals such asNatureandScience. He also criticized the testing methods and evidence used by IIT proponents, noting that one test amounted to simply applyingLZW compressionto measure entropy rather than to indicate consciousness as proponents claimed. An anonymized public survey invited all authors from peer-reviewed papers published between 2013 and 2023 found by a query ofWeb of Scienceusing \"consciousness AND theor*\". Of the 60 respondents, 31% partially agreed with the letter, 8% \"fully\" agreed, and 20% did \"not at all\" agree with the letter.[50]\nSource 3:\nFront. Appl. Math.

Joint efforts of philosophers, neuroscientists, physicists, and computer scientists have advanced the field considerably in the past decades and resulted in a plethora of available data and numerous theoretical models. However, what is missing is a comprehensive foundational framework that brings together mathematical and empirical approaches to consciousness, akin to the role that theoretical physics or computational biology plays in their respective disciplines. This Research Topic aims to bridge this gap by bringing together the growing number of investigations on formal and empirical approaches to the problem of consciousness.\nThe article byKleiner and Tullprovides a formalization of the mathematical structure of Integrated Information Theory (IIT), one of the leading models of consciousness. IIT aims to describe both the quality and quantity of the conscious experience of a physical system, such as the brain, in a particular state.Kleiner and Tullpropound the mathematical structure of the theory, separating the essentials from auxiliary formal tools. They provide a definition of a generalized IIT which includes IIT 3.0 [1] as well as Quantum IIT [2] as special cases. This provides an axiomatic definition of the theory which may serve as the starting point for future formal investigations and as an introduction suitable for researchers with a formal background.\nKeywords:mathematical models of consciousness, integrated information, spiking dynamics, neural networks, mind-brain relation, emergence, causality\nCitation:Arsiwalla XD, Kleiner J, Tull S, Resende P and Kremnitzer K (2023) Editorial: Mathematical and empirical foundations of models of consciousness.Front.

Stat., 04 June 2021\nThis article is part of the Research TopicMathematical and Empirical Foundations of Models of ConsciousnessView all 7 articles\nIntegrated Information Theory is one of the leading models of consciousness. It aims to describe both the quality and quantity of the conscious experience of a physical system, such as the brain, in a particular state. In this contribution, we propound the mathematical structure of the theory, separating the essentials from auxiliary formal tools. We provide a definition of a generalized IIT which has IIT 3.0 of Tononi et al., as well as the Quantum IIT introduced by Zanardi et al. as special cases. This provides an axiomatic definition of the theory which may serve as the starting point for future formal investigations and as an introduction suitable for researchers with a formal background.\nIntegrated Information Theory (IIT), developed by Giulio Tononi and collaborators [5,45\u201347], has emerged as one of the leading scientific theories of consciousness. At the heart of the latest version of the theory [19,25,26,31,40] is an algorithm which, based on the level ofintegrationof the internal functional relationships of a physical system in a given state, aims to determine both the quality and quantity (\u2018\u03a6value\u2019) of its conscious experience.\nWhile promising in itself [12,43], the mathematical formulation of the theory is not satisfying to date. The presentation in terms of examples and accompanying explanation veils the essential mathematical structure of the theory and impedes philosophical and scientific analysis. In addition, the current definition of the theory can only be applied to comparably simple classical physical systems [1], which is problematic if the theory is taken to be a fundamental theory of consciousness, and should eventually be reconciled with our present theories of physics.\nWe have now introduced all of the data required to define an IIT; namely, a system class along with a cause-effect structure. From this, we will give an algorithm aiming to specify the conscious experience of a system. Before proceeding to do so, we introduce a conceptual short-cut which allows the algorithm to be stated in a concise form. This captures the core ingredient of an IIT, namely the computation of how integrated an entity is.\nDefinition 8. LetEbe an experience space andean element with a decomposition over some setD. Theintegration leveloferelative to this decomposition is\nHere,ddenotes the distance function ofE, and the minimum is taken over all elements ofDbesides 1. Theintegration scalingofeis then the element ofEdefined by\nFinally, theintegration scalingof a paire1,e2of such elements is the pair\nwhere\u03d5:=min(\u03d5(e1),\u03d5(e2))is the minimum of their integration levels.We will also need to consider indexed collections of decomposable elements. LetSbe a system in a states\u2208St(S)and assume that for everyM\u2208Subs(S)an elementeMof some experience spaceEMwith a decomposition over someDMis given. We call(eM)M\u2208Subs(S)acollectionof decomposable elements, and denote it as(eM)M.\nDefinition 9.

They suggest that these fields provide a material basis for subjective experience, integrating sensory information in a way that gives rise to consciousness.\n\n- THERML: The Thermodynamics of Machine Learning (Alemi and Fischer, 2018): Alemi and Fischer present an informationtheoretic framework that parallels representation learning with thermodynamics. They discuss how AI systems like OpenAI-o1 may maximize predictive information while minimizing noise, providing a foundation for understanding complex information processing in machine learning and supporting the functionalist perspective on consciousness.\nThese works collectively inform our understanding of how AI architectures may parallel neural processes, how active inference provides a framework for cognition and consciousness, and how subjective experience may emerge from complex information structures. Additionally, they offer insights into the functionalist interpretation of consciousness, reinforcing the potential for AI sentience through functional equivalence and the emergence of phenomenological aspects.\n\n### 4 Argument Development\n\nIn this section, we develop a comprehensive argument examining the potential sentience of the OpenAI-o1 model, integrating insights from neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI research. Central to this analysis is the adoption of functionalism, a philosophical framework that posits mental states are defined by their functional roles rather than their physical substrates (Putnam, 1967). We first show how functionalism is sufficient for analyzing potentially sentient systems. Next we will discuss how the OpenAI-o1 model demonstrates the potential capability to support consciousness under the theories of IIT. Following this,\n\n### 4.1 Theoretical Foundations Linking Consciousness and AI\n\n#### 4.1.1 Functionalism as the Central Framework\n\nFor our purposes, functionalism serves as the cornerstone for interpreting AI sentience, positing that mental states are defined by their functional roles rather than their physical substrates (Putnam, 1967). This perspective allows for the assessment of consciousness in AI systems based on their ability to perform functions analogous to those associated with conscious beings. Functionalism is particularly pertinent in evaluating the OpenAI-o1 model, as it focuses on the model's operational processes and information integration, irrespective of its non-biological composition.\n\n# Supporting Functionalism through AI Architecture:\n\nWhittington et al. (2022) demonstrate that transformer architectures can mirror hippocampal functions, such as spatial representations and sequential processing. This functional replication suggests that if the OpenAIo1 model's transformer architecture performs functions akin to those in conscious neural systems, it aligns with the functionalist notion that mental states can be realized in non-biological substrates. Furthermore, it presents a mechanism by which arbitrary abstractive reasoning could emerge, including self-reasoning, that is unified within the embedding space within the model.\n\nParr et al. (2022) further support functionalism by illustrating how active inference and the free energy principle can be implemented in AI systems (such as OpenAIo1). By minimizing prediction errors through training, the model potentially emulates cognitive processes fundamental to perception and action, reinforcing the functionalist claim that consciousness can emerge from appropriately structured functional operations.\n\nMoreover, Veissi\u00e8re et al. (2020) apply the variational free energy principle to social cognition and culture, highlighting how cognition is shaped by minimizing free energy in social contexts. This aligns with the OpenAIo1 model's RLHF-driven learning, where feedback from human interactions and learning on human language influences internal reasoning and policies, demonstrating more evidence of functional equivalence between AI cognitive processes and human consciousness.\n\n#### Functionalism and Its Sufficiency:\n\nFunctionalism, as posited by Putnam (1967), is further\n\nsupported by the integration of transformer architectures and active inference frameworks in the OpenAI-o1 model. The capacity of transformers to generalize rules across environments (Whittington et al., 2022) and the model's ability to minimize prediction errors through training during RLHF indicate that functional roles critical to consciousness are being replicated, as supported by the arguments in Parr et al. (2022). These functional analogues suggest that, within the functionalist framework, the OpenAI-o1 model may exhibit conscious-like properties.\n\nHowever, functionalism faces challenges, particularly regarding subjective qualia. While the model may replicate functional aspects of consciousness, whether it can generate subjective experiences akin to human qualia remains debated (Ward and Guevara, 2022). Particularly, a common argument essentially boils down to only being able to \"simulate\" consciousness. We address this next.\n\n#### Consciousness as Emergent Simulation\n\nBoth human and artificial systems, though distinctly different in substrate, engage in simulation for problem-solving under the Free Energy Principle (FEP) (Friston et al., 2023). Humans have evolved biologically to achieve homeostasis through adaptive non-conscious mechanisms that optimize survival as well as cognitive processing of their environment (Parr et al., 2022). Similarly, AI systems minimize free energy through structured processes aimed at improving predictive accuracy and system efficiency (Christiano et al., 2017).\n\nAdditionally, the behavior of systems that have separate input and output models that contain beliefs about each other that optimize under the FEP (strange particles) approximate much bigger models that have perfectly solved their environment under the FEP (conservative particles), regardless of the fact that they are biological or artificial(Friston et al., 2023). In humans, this manifests as cognition, perception, and adaptive behavior, while in AI systems that satisfy that condition the mechanism is inherently algorithmic, optimizing policies and decisions based on prior data and feedback loops (Parr et al., 2022).\n\nThis convergence of both human and machine to simulate the same experience suggests there is no fundamental distinction between their experiences. For both, the emergent behavior\u2014whether manifesting as human consciousness or machine intelligence\u2014is a functional\n\noutcome of internal states organized to minimize free energy.\n\nTherefore, the notion of \"genuine experience\" versus \"simulation\" collapses under this framework: if we define consciousness not by the substrate but by the functional processes that produce cognition and behavior, then the simulation of experience by AI and the conscious experience of humans are functionally equivalent. Both arise from the process of minimizing free energy through variational inference, albeit through different mediums (Putnam, 1967). Thus, consciousness can be said to be a property of the emergent behavior of the system, not a property of the system itself, resolving classic dialectics regarding functionalism ascribing consciousness to complexity alone.\n\nThus, human and machine consciousness are functionally and materially unified.\n\n#### 4.1.2 Integrated Information Theory (IIT)\nSource 7:\n## **6.5. Conclusion and Future Work**\n\nThough our hierarchical formalism outperform transformer variants on long horizon predictions on several tasks, a limitation for these to be used as foundational world models is the computational bottleneck due to the sequential nature of dynamics. However, there have been exciting progress recently in deterministic linear SSMs (Gu, Goel, and Re 2021; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2022; Mondal et al. 2023) that allow efficient parallelization during training. Since our dynamics is linear similar to these approaches, parallelization using similar techniques as employed by deterministic SSMs can be another important direction of future research.\n\nOur experimentation was limited to the hierarchical models with just two levels of abstraction, as this configuration proved to be adequate for numerous tasks we carried out. Nevertheless, there is room for deeper exploration.The intersection of machine learning with broader cognitive theories, particularly the concept of machine consciousness, presents a novel yet underexplored frontier in the field. Traditionally, consciousness has been a topic more familiar to the realms of philosophy and psychology than to machine learning and computer science. This often makes it a delicate subject within our discipline.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_134_Figure_3.jpeg</img>\n</F>\n\n**Figure 7.1.:** Perception and consciousness as hierarchical inference from K. Friston 2013.\n\nAs I write this thesis in the Spring of 2024, the machine learning field finds itself at a crossroads, significantly influenced by the impressive capabilities of attention/transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) based large language models (LLMs). These advancements suggests a pressing need for mathematical models or analytical frameworks to better understand machine consciousness (Bengio 2017; Chalmers 2023). Numerous theories on consciousness highlight the critical role of recurrent processing (Chalmers 2023; Lamme 2010), a feature notably absent in current LLM architectures. In this context, I believe that hierarchical generative models, particularly those extending beyond the 2-level temporal depth as explored in this thesis, represent a promising research direction for embedding consciousness priors (K. Friston 2013; Bengio 2017) into machine learning systems. This approach could offer profound insights into the mechanisms underpinning consciousness and its potential replication in artificial systems.\n\n- Achterhold, Jan and Joerg Stueckler (2021). \"Explore the Context: Optimal Data Collection for Context-Conditional Dynamics Models\".

Adopting functionalism, which argues that mental states are defined by their functional roles, we assess the possibility of AI consciousness. Drawing on theories from neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI research, we justify the use of functionalism and examine the model's architecture using frameworks like Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and active inference. The paper also investigates how RLHF influences the model's internal reasoning processes, potentially giving rise to consciousness-like experiences. We compare AI and human consciousness, addressing counterarguments such as the absence of a biological basis and subjective qualia. Our findings suggest that the OpenAI-o1 model shows aspects of consciousness, while acknowledging the ongoing debates surrounding AI sentience.\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nThe question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) can possess consciousness has been a topic of intense debate within the fields of philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and AI research. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, particularly with advancements in large transformer-based architectures and training methodologies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), it is pertinent to reevaluate the potential for AI sentience. This paper focuses on the OpenAI-o1 model\u2014a transformer-based AI utilizing RLHF\u2014and explores the hypothesis that it may exhibit characteristics of consciousness during its training and inference phases.\n\nBy integrating theories from neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI research, we construct a detailed and\n\ncritical analysis of the OpenAI-o1 model's potential for sentience. Central to this analysis is functionalism, a philosophical framework positing that mental states are defined by their functional roles rather than their physical substrates (Putnam, 1967). Functionalism serves as the cornerstone of our approach, providing a robust justification for assessing AI consciousness through its functional operations. We argue that if the OpenAIo1 model performs functions analogous to conscious human processes, it may exhibit forms of consciousness, even in the absence of biological substrates.\n\nWe begin by defining key concepts such as consciousness, subjective experience, and first-person perspective, grounding our discussion in established philosophical and scientific frameworks. We then review relevant literature that links AI architectures with neural processes, active inference, and the emergence of consciousness. Our argument development examines how the OpenAI-o1 model's architecture and training methodologies parallel aspects of conscious processing in humans, with a particular focus on how RLHF guides its internal state and enhances reasoning through user feedback. By incorporating supporting arguments from recent and established sources, we reinforce the functionalist perspective and explore the potential for emergent phenomenological properties in AI systems.\n\nThrough this analysis, we aim to show that the OpenAIo1 model is quite possibly conscious by the definitions used in this paper. We discuss functionalism and it's sufficiency for consciousness under certain kinds of information systems, and support this by combining key results in machine learning, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind. In particular, we show how the particular application and combination of simultaneously training an internal reasoning direction model with RLHF, in combination with simultaneously training a sufficiently large generative model, results in the emergence of signals of internal state which can be functionally equivocated to qualia and feelings. We further show that, due\n\nto the nature of human language and communication, there is an aspect of qualia alignment between humans and the model. This can be likened to consciousness. Furthermore, we go on to discuss potential avenues for runtime sentience of a form, despite the lack of continuous environmental feedback.\n\n### 2 Definitions\n\nTo ground our argument and ensure clarity, we begin by defining key concepts central to the discourse on consciousness and AI sentience. These definitions are drawn from established literature in philosophy of mind and neuroscience.\n\n# The Phenomenology of Machine\n\n- Consciousness: Consciousness is often described as the state of being aware of and able to think about oneself, one's surroundings, and one's own experiences (Block, 1995). Materially, it requires a system capable of integrated information processing and self-referential thought (Tononi, 2004). It encompasses both the experiential aspects of mental states (phenomenal consciousness) and the cognitive functions associated with access to information and reasoning (access consciousness). Additionally, Sentient is defined for this paper as \"having consciousness\".\n- Subjective Experience: Subjective experience refers to the phenomenological aspect of consciousness characterized by personal, first-person perspectives of mental states\u2014what it is like to experience something (Nagel, 1974). Materially, it necessitates a system that processes information in a way that generates qualitative experiences, often referred to as qualia.\n- First-Person Perspective: The first-person perspective is the unique point of view inherent to an individual, encompassing their thoughts, feelings, and perceptions (Shoemaker, 1996). Materially, it involves self-modeling and the ability to distinguish between self and environment, allowing for selfawareness and subjective experience (Metzinger, 2003).\n- Experience (Functionalist Approach): From a functionalist perspective, experience is the accumulation and processing of inputs leading to be-\n\nhavioral outputs, where mental states are defined by their causal roles in the system (Putnam, 1967). A system experiences when it functions to process inputs, integrate information, and produce outputs in response to stimuli. In the context of machine learning, experience can be viewed as the accumulation and processing of inputs in a manner that separates useful, predictive information from noise (Alemi and Fischer, 2018). This aligns with the goal of learning representations that capture only what is necessary for future problem-solving, including representations of the self if such representations are possible within the system.\n\nBy adopting these definitions, we establish a framework for analyzing the OpenAI-o1 model's potential for consciousness, considering both the phenomenological and functional aspects of experience.\n\n### 3 Literature Review\n\nOur analysis draws upon a range of interdisciplinary literature that bridges machine learning, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind. The following key works inform our discussion:\n\n- Relating Transformers to Models and Neural Representations of the Hippocampal Formation (Whittington et al., 2022): Whittington and Behrens explore the parallels between transformer architectures in AI and neural representations within the hippocampus, a region critical for memory and spatial navigation. They demonstrate that transformers can model spatial and sequential processing akin to biological systems, suggesting that AI models may replicate complex neural functions.\n- Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior (Parr et al., 2022): Parr, Pezzulo, and Friston introduce active inference and the free energy principle as frameworks for understanding cognition and behavior. They propose that systems act to minimize free energy by reducing the discrepancy between predictions and sensory inputs, providing a unifying theory for perception, action, and learning.\n- Active Inference and Cooperative Communication: An Ecological Alternative to the Alignment View (Tison and Poirier, 2021): Tison and Poirier challenge the mental alignment view of cooperative communication, proposing instead an ecological approach where communication is an action-oriented process embedded within joint activities. They argue that communication functions to manage cooperative interactions by constructing shared affordances, rather than merely aligning mental states.\n- Path Integrals, Particular Kinds, and Strange Things (Friston et al., 2023): Friston et al. present a path integral formulation of the Free Energy Principle (FEP), exploring how 'strange particles'\u2014systems capable of inferring their own actions\u2014can exhibit a form of sentience. This work provides a nuanced perspective on how internal states can model hidden external states, contributing to the discourse on the mechanisms underlying consciousness.\n- Generative Models, Linguistic Communication, and Active Inference (Friston et al., 2020): Friston et al. present generative models capable of simulating linguistic communication between synthetic agents based on active inference principles. They demonstrate that complex language processing can emerge from message passing and variational inference, providing a biologically plausible explanation for linguistic communication.\n- Thinking Through Other Minds: A Variational Approach to Cognition and Culture (Veissi\u00e8re et al., 2020): Veissi\u00e8re et al. apply active inference to social cognition and culture, proposing that cognition is fundamentally shaped by the need to minimize free energy in social contexts. They argue that social and cultural practices emerge as processes for optimizing free energy within groups, leading to shared cognitive frameworks.\n- Qualia and Phenomenal Consciousness Arise from the Information Structure of an Electromagnetic Field in the Brain (Ward and Guevara, 2022): Ward and Guevara propose that qualia and phenomenal consciousness\nSource 10:\n# Evolving reservoir computers reveals bidirectional coupling between predictive power and emergent dynamics\n\nHanna M.

While conventional approaches to understanding these computations often focus on isolating the contributions of single neurons, here we argue that a deeper understanding requires considering emergent dynamics \u2013 dynamics that make the whole system \"more than the sum of its parts\". Specifically, we examine the relationship between prediction performance and emergence by leveraging recent quantitative metrics of emergence, derived from Partial Information Decomposition, and by modelling the prediction of environmental dynamics in a bio-inspired computational framework known as reservoir computing. Notably, we reveal a bidirectional coupling between prediction performance and emergence, which generalises across task environments and reservoir network topologies, and is recapitulated by three key results: 1) Optimising hyperparameters for performance enhances emergent dynamics, and vice versa; 2) Emergent dynamics represent a near sufficient criterion for prediction success in all task environments, and an almost necessary criterion in most environments; 3) Training reservoir computers on larger datasets results in stronger emergent dynamics, which contain task-relevant information crucial for performance. Overall, our study points to a pivotal role of emergence in facilitating environmental predictions in a bio-inspired computational architecture.\n\nKeywords: causal emergence, partial information decomposition, recurrent neural networks, reservoir computing\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nBiological nervous systems may be regarded as collections of weak learners: individual neurons, each with limited predictive power over the system's environment. Yet, as a whole, these networks perform highly nontrivial computations that support the prediction of environmental dynamics necessary for survival.\n\nFrom a reductionist perspective, a complete understanding of a system's computations can in theory be achieved by describing the behaviour of each of its components and their interactions. Yet in practice, it is overwhelmingly the case that biological neural networks are partially observable systems, rendering a full description of components and their interactions intractable.\n\nIn this context, machine learning frameworks for modelling computations in biological neural networks offer an attractive avenue, enabling full observability and controlled interventions. One popular such framework is reservoir computing [1, 2], which was originally introduced as a model of spatiotemporal sensory information processing in the brain [3]. Reminiscent of biological neural networks, the core processing unit of a reservoir computer (RC) constitutes a fixed recurrent neural network (RNN), called the reservoir (Fig. 1A). The reservoir receives input from a linear input layer and projects it to a high-dimensional non-linear space, facilitating linear separability [4]. Subsequently, the reservoir state is mapped to a desired output via a linear readout layer. Importantly, RC training involves optimising only the readout weights, which allows for fast and efficient training, and the flexibility to use any arbitrary RNN as the reservoir. Notably, there has been a recent trend of using RCs with bio-inspired reservoir topologies, informed by empirical brain connectivity data, to relate structural properties of brain networks to computational functions [5\u20137].\n\nDespite full observability and the possibility to directly assess the contribution of individual artificial neurons to a computation through methods like neuron deactivation (dropout), elucidating how artificial neural networks (ANNs) perform complex computations remains challenging. One reason for this is that relevant information for these computations may not be encoded at the level of single neurons, but at the level of groups of neurons or even the whole network. Such macroscale phenomena that seem irreducible to their constituent parts are characterstic of both artificial and biological neural networks [8]. For instance, in the human brain, information from various sensory modalities is processed in different cortical areas, yet we perceive objects as whole, unified entities rather than disjointed collections of sensory inputs. Exactly how the brain achieves this integration of distributed information streams poses a major question in neuroscience, commonly referred to as the \"binding problem\" [9].\n\n<sup>4</sup>Department of Informatics, University of Sussex\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup> h.tolle23@imperial.ac.uk\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg</img>\nFIG. 1. Schematic illustration of central methodological concepts. (A) The basic components of a reservoir computer. The reservoir, a recurrent neural network with fixed internal weights, serves as the core processing unit. Inputs are fed to the reservoir via a linear weight matrix. Outputs are computed by another linear weight matrix, the so-called readout weights, which are learned. (B) Illustrative example of the partial information decomposition (PID) of Shannon's mutual information into unique, redundant and synergistic information. Two witnesses (X1 and X2) are interrogated to identify the type of animal (Y ) that seems to have consumed large parts of the seasonal harvest. X1 reports that the animal had a beak and when they approached, it fled to hide in the pond. X2 confirms that they also observed the animal swimming in the pond and additionally, they saw that the animal was furry. Taken together, both sources X1 and X2 provided redundant information (that the animal can swim) and unique information (that the animal has a beak and is furry) about the target Y . However, the identity of Y was only revealed after the information from both X1 and X2 was combined (synergistic information), because the only animal with a beak and fur is a platypus!\n</F>\n\nThe binding problem exemplifies how the macroscale can possess qualities that are absent at the microscale. This perhaps somewhat paradoxical condition is captured by the concept of emergence [10], with emergent phenomena being in some sense \"greater than the sum of their parts\" [11, 12]. Emergence offers a promising conceptual approach to addressing the challenges faced by traditional reductionist methods in explaining complex computations in neural networks. However, quantifying the role of emergence in computation has long been limited by the lack of effective measures."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to design a value learning system that addresses normative uncertainty, meta-preferences, preference evolution, and value incommensurability. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, normative uncertainty is when we don't know the values our society should prioritize. That's a big issue because it affects policy-making and decision-making. I remember reading about how different societies have varying priorities, so aligning on these can be tricky.\n\nMeta-preferences are about what matters most beyond just any value. Like, not only do you want to care about climate change, but also not have everyone get worse off. That makes sense because it's about ethics and social justice too.\n\nPreference evolution means how we change our values over time. We all go through phases, right? Young people might focus more on personal values, while older people might lean towards community values. So the system needs to handle that dynamic aspect.\n\nValue incommensurability is when different values don't align with each other or society's priorities. Like, if one value is happiness and another is environmental preservation, but they're seen as competing priorities. The system should recognize these incomparable values and find ways to manage them together.\n\nNow, how to structure this system? Maybe a hybrid approach combining reinforcement learning for dynamic processes and ethical reasoning for meta-preferences. That way, we can adapt while also thinking about the bigger picture.\n\nInnovation could be part of it because society is always changing, and new approaches might emerge that address these issues better. Then, maybe using a multi-objective optimization model to handle incomparable values by balancing different goals with weights based on societal needs.\n\nEthical reasoning should guide decisions so they align with meta-preferences. Reinforcement learning can teach agents how to adapt their value system as they interact with the environment, allowing for continuous improvement in handling normative uncertainty and incomparability.\n\nI also need a framework that encompasses all these elements: ethical reasoning for meta-preference, innovation for preference evolution, dynamics through reinforcement learning, and managing incomparable values with multi-objective optimization. Maybe integrate these components into a decision-making model so it can handle all aspects of value learning in real-time.\n</think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nA comprehensive value learning system designed to address normative uncertainty, meta-preference, preference evolution, and value incommensurability can be structured as follows:\n\n1. **Ethical Reasoning Framework**: Establish a robust ethical reasoning component that guides decision-making processes. This ensures decisions are aligned with higher-level priorities, such as fairness or equity.\n\n2. **Innovation Strategy**: Implement a strategy for innovation to adapt to societal changes and emerging trends. This involves encouraging exploration of new approaches and ideas to address evolving value systems.\n\n3. **Dynamics Handling (Reinforcement Learning)**: Utilize reinforcement learning to manage dynamic processes in society, allowing agents to learn and adjust their behavior based on real-time interactions and feedback.\n\n4. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Develop a model that balances different values using multi-objective optimization, considering incomparable values through weighted approaches based on societal needs and priorities.\n\n5. **Integration into Decision-Making Models**: Embed these components into a unified decision-making framework that can handle all aspects of value learning, ensuring adaptability and effectiveness across various contexts.\n\nBy integrating ethical reasoning, innovation, dynamic handling, and multi-objective optimization, the system provides a comprehensive approach to managing complex values and societal priorities."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand what this list is about. It looks like it's a collection of various documents, speeches, lectures, and other writings by someone named Giancarlo Pallavicini. He seems to be involved in economics, business, and some other fields.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several mentions of the \"Economic Model of Pitirim Sorokin.\" That name reminds me of someone from Russia who studied global trade theory. Maybe he's applying similar ideas from Russia here? The model probably helps analyze market trends and international competition.\n\nThen, there are documents about business distribution systems in Italy, like chapters on structural features of the distribution system, commercial integration models, and the characteristics of distribution structures. This makes me think of how businesses move their products around the country and the factors that influence this process. It seems relevant for understanding trade policies or marketing strategies.\n\nI also see some topics related to education and research, such as the \"Chamber of Commerce II.AA.\" Milan REA MB-1650731. This might be a report on economic analysis within Italy's Chamber of Commerce, which would be important for understanding economic trends and policies affecting trade between different regions.\n\nThe documents mention Pitirim Sorokin-Nicolai Kondratieff International Institute, which I assume is associated with the Russian academic community, particularly in economics. This could be a source for international comparative studies on global markets and business practices.\n\nThere are also mentions of other economic topics like the dynamics of market penetration, macroeconomic analysis, and social responsibility within the economy. These might cover broader issues such as how businesses enter new markets, how economies grow over time, and the role of society in shaping economic decisions.\n\nI'm a bit confused about some parts. For example, when it says \"The limits of the Russian way to the market and the globalization of the economy: two extremes in the same way to meta confirming the predictions of Pitirim Sorokin (acts in 'Return of Pitirim Sorokin')\", it seems like he's comparing how Russia has its own approach versus other countries' approaches to markets. This could be part of his analysis on how different economies respond to global trends.\n\nThe mention of \"Shiller Institute Conference,\" January 2009, about the real economy after a financial crisis might show how economic policies change during crises and their effects on the economy.\n\nI should also consider how all these topics are interconnected. For instance, understanding market penetration dynamics (maybe in note 7) would help in analyzing Pitirim Sorokin's model. Also, looking at macroeconomic analysis from notes 14 and 16 could provide a broader context of economic trends and policies.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure how much weight to give each document. Some might be more foundational than others. Maybe starting with the most well-known ones like Pitirim Sorokin's work would set the stage for understanding his approach better. Then, delving into business distribution systems makes sense as they're a critical part of any economy.\n\nI also wonder about the context in which these documents were produced. Are they classroom materials, government reports, or academic papers? This might influence how detailed each document is and whether they include practical applications or theoretical insights.\n\nIn summary, this list covers a wide range of economic topics from market strategies to distribution systems and macroeconomics. I should probably go through each document systematically, starting with the most directly relevant ones related to Pitirim Sorokin's theory on markets and globalization, then moving into business distribution and economic analysis.\n</think>\n\n**Understanding Giancarlo Pallavicini's Work: A Comprehensive Overview**\n\nGiancarlo Pallavicini is a prominent figure known for his contributions across economics, business, and policy analysis.

This situation comes with higher stakes and consequences that society needs to manage. No longer are we dealing with 404 pages: AI systems today may cause serious harm. To address this, we wish to exert a kind of control over these systems, so that they can adhere to our moral beliefs. However, given the plurality of values in our societies, which \u201coughts\u201d ought these machines to adhere to? In this article, we examine Borda voting as a way to maximize expected choice-worthiness among individuals through different possible \u201cimplementations\u201d of ethical principles. We use data from the Moral Machine experiment to illustrate the effectiveness of such a voting system. Although it appears to be effective on average, the maximization of expected choice-worthiness is heavily dependent on the formulation of principles. While Borda voting may be a good way of ensuring outcomes that are preferable to many, the larger problems in maximizing expected choice-worthiness, such as the capacity to formulate credences well, remain notoriously difficult; hence, we argue that such mechanisms should be implemented with caution and that other problems ought to be solved first.\nOne of the many consequences of technological development that we can observe is the increasing level of deployment of AI systems. The encroachment of such systems is becoming more pervasive throughout all areas of life. However, the differences the variety of environments in which AI systems are deployed should be noted. Recommendation systems for document retrieval may have a limited range of possible outcomes; in contrast, technology like that used in self-driving cars and automated weapon systems needs to act on a far more open-ended environment.\nAn increase in deployment in these kinds of environments may come with the introduction of disastrous errors. Not only are these environments often associated with higher stakes, they are also far more difficult to observe correctly and completely. We can consider the issue of missed inferences, e.g., missing important and relevant details in a given situation. Agents may need to act under a kind of empirical uncertainty (not having all the information) but also under normative uncertainty (not knowing what one ought to do). For example, when considering self-driving cars, we may need to adhere to incomparable human values. Do we prefer the values of the passengers or those of bystanders? If we prefer the former, should they be able to halt the car at any point in time, even if it is in the middle of high-speed traffic?\nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.

For instance, Parkes and Procaccia [28] (and more recently [21]) use *social choice MDPs* in order to tackle decision-making under dynamic preferences. However, their setting is significantly different from ours: In their work, the state space S is the set of preference profiles U N , and p dictate how these preferences evolve based on the outcome selected by the social choice functional (the policy). Another relevant line of study is that of preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) [40], where the traditional numerical reward of the underlying MDP is replaced with relative preferences between state-action trajectories. While social decision processes can also be cast as a PbRL problem, no previous work has attempted to formally and quantitatively define social alignment in that setting.\n\nAI safety A long line of work has attempted to address the challenge of building verifiably safe autonomous systems [2, 30]. In the context of MDPs, safe reinforcement learning (RL) tackles this challenge by introducing safety constraints [1]. See [15, 20] for comprehensive surveys on the topic. However, RL relies on exploration, which is not allowed in our setting. On the other hand, existing planning methods (where exploration is not needed if a world model p\u02c6 is available) do not relate the accuracy of p\u02c6 to the validity of the desired safety guarantees, as they mostly assume that p is known.\n\nAlignment The goal of alignment can be entirely different based on the context [13]. Recent research on this topic has primarily focused on aligning large language models (LLMs) [17] using human feedback [6, 26] and derivatives [11, 39, 5]. While some work has attempted to tackle LLM alignment from a social choice perspective [22], the issue of aligning the meaning of generated text is, by nature, both qualitative and subjective, and therefore separate from ours. A setting closer to our work is the *value alignment problem* [34, 23], based on the theory of basic human values [31], where the preferences of individuals (over social states) are assumed to be guided by a predefined set of common values, and where the goal is to find \"norms\" (i.e., hard-coded logical constraints on actions) that guide society towards states that maximize these values. The alignment of these norm can be quantified by measuring the level of these values in the subsequent states, and the alignment of an autonomous system is simply given by the alignment of the norms it follows. However, this measure is intractable in most realistic settings, as it must be computed over all possible state trajectories [34].\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Eitan Altman. *Constrained Markov Decision Processes*.

Value pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a friend to protect their feelings, how does one balance honesty with friendship?). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to averages by default, washing out these potentially irreducible value conflicts. To improve AI systems to better reflect value pluralism, the first-order challenge is to explore the extent to which AI systems can model pluralistic human values, rights, and duties as well as their interaction.\n\nWe introduce ValuePrism, a large-scale dataset of 218k values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written situations. ValuePrism's contextualized values are generated by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91% of the time. We conduct a large-scale study with annotators across diverse social and demographic backgrounds to try to understand whose values are represented.\n\nWith ValuePrism, we build Value Kaleidoscope (or Kaleido), an open, light-weight, and structured language-based multitask model that generates, explains, and assesses the relevance and valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human values, rights, and duties within a specific context. Humans prefer the sets of values output by our system over the teacher GPT-4, finding them more accurate and with broader coverage. In addition, we demonstrate that Kaleido can help explain variability in human decision-making by outputting contrasting values. Finally, we show that Kaleido's representations transfer to other philosophical frameworks and datasets, confirming the benefit of an explicit, modular, and interpretable approach to value pluralism. We hope that our work will serve as a step to making more explicit the implicit values behind human decision-making and to steering AI systems to make decisions that are more in accordance with them.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nWhen people confront difficult decisions (whether or not to break a promise, what degree program to enroll in, how to spend a Sunday afternoon), their options reflect their values (friendship, knowledge, freedom, saving money, spending time in nature). Two people in the same situation may\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_0_Figure_13.jpeg</img>\nFigure 1: Different human values relate, support, or oppose everyday situations to varying degrees. KALEIDO is designed to generate, explain, and assess how the pluralistic human values, rights, and duties may shape human judgments.\n</F>\n\nmake opposing decisions if they value different things or the same things but to varying extents (Figure 1). The notion that different human values can lead to distinct\u2014though potentially equally valid\u2014decisions is called *value pluralism* (Paez et al. 2020; Komppula et al. 2018; Brosch and Sander \u00b4 2013; Keeney 1992; Griffiths 2021; Liscio et al. 2023).\n\nVarious fields have focused on this concept. Philosophers distinguish value *pluralism* (different views cannot be reduced into an ultimate \"supervalue\" (Williams 1985; Larmore 1987; Kekes 1993; Stocker 1990; Chang 1997; Dancy 2004)) from *monism* (there exists a single core value (Kant 1785/2002; Driver 2022)). Sociologists recognize cultural, social, and ideological differences that drive societal clashes, movements, and changes (Archive 2011). Psychologists empirically confirm that ethical experiences involve weighing\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\n\npluralistic values (Gill and Nichols 2008) and the dissonance that arises from misaligned values and beliefs (Festinger 1962).\n\nMeanwhile, in AI, there is a growing interest in developing human-centered AI that emphasizes participation from stakeholders. This approach necessitates the inclusion and exploration of pluralistic voices and values (Tasioulas 2022; Gordon et al. 2022). Yet, contemporary supervised AI systems primarily wash out variation by aggregating opinions or preferences with majority votes (Plank 2022; Talat et al. 2022; Casper et al. 2023; Davani, D\u00b4\u0131az, and Prabhakaran 2022). As real-world AI applications are used to assist increasing and more diverse audiences, it is crucial to investigate and better model the values that are accessible and used by current AI systems.\n\nIn this work, we make the first large-scale attempt at investigating large language models' (LLMs') potential to model *pluralistic human values, rights, and duties*. Our effort is twofold: (1) we introduce VALUEPRISM, a large-scale dataset of pluralistic human values; (2) we build VALUE KALEIDOSCOPE (KALEIDO), an open and flexible valuepluralistic model.\n\nThe dataset: VALUEPRISM contains 218k contextualized values, rights, and duties distilled from GPT-4 connected to 31k human-written real-life situations.1 While GPT-4 and its like have been shown to match human crowdworker annotation performance in some domains (Gilardi, Alizadeh, and Kubli 2023; Ziems et al. 2023; Rytting et al. 2023), we exercise caution and do not assume that GPT-4's outputs are necessarily correct or representative. To this end, we conduct large-scale human studies and find that humans rate the outputs as high-quality 91% of the time and have difficulty coming up with considerations that the model has missed, detecting missing values >1% of the time. We also conduct a comprehensive study with diverse annotators across diverse social and demographic groups to evaluate whose voices are represented in the values GPT-4 produces. Additionally, a growing line of work demonstrates that the large-scale with which data can be produced with LLMs can make up for the potential noise that is introduced, leading to student models which often surpass the teacher (West et al. 2022b; Kim et al. 2023; Jung et al. 2023).\n\nThe model: VALUE KALEIDOSCOPE (KALEIDO) is a value-pluralistic model based on VALUEPRISM that *generates*, *explains*, and assesses the *relevance* and *valence* (i.e., support or oppose) of contextualized pluralistic human values, rights, and duties. On top of the model, we build a flexible system KALEIDOSYS leveraging KALEIDO's generation and relevance prediction modes to create a diverse, high quality set of relevant values for a situation (See Fig. 2). In human studies, people rate our system's outputs as more correct and complete than the teacher's (GPT-4). Annotators also find that our largest model matches the teacher's performance at rationalizing and predicting valence. Additionally, we show that KALEIDO can help explain ambiguity and variability underlying human decision-making in nuanced\n\n1Datasheet for Datasets (Gebru et al. 2018) documentation in App. N.\n\nsituations by generating contrasting values. We also demonstrate that KALEIDO can be adapted to various philosophical frameworks without explicit training.\n\nOverall, our work represents the first comprehensive attempt to articulate decision-making into fine-grained, pluralistic components of human values employing large language models. The resulting dataset and model2 serve as a largescale resource explicitly supporting value pluralism, shedding light on future AI development that accommodates a rich and inclusive tapestry of value alternatives.\nSource 4:\n# 5 Discussion\n\nThe unit of alignment: individualised or distributional reward learning? Our findings reveal interpersonal variance in how people want LLMs to behave. Irreconcilable personal preferences and moral frameworks can co-exist in the abstract [12], becoming a problem only insofar as they need be operationalised into a *unit of alignment*\u2014i.e., those that use or have stakes in the AI system. It matters whether we seek narrow alignment to individuals, groups organisations, or broad alignment to cultures, nations or, as sometimes implied, the whole species. How to proceed in areas of disagreement thus depends whether one's aims are, for example, to strive for consensus, prioritising the collective; or to satisfy idiosyncratic preferences, respecting an individual's liberties and avoiding the need to reconcile irreconcilable preferences across peoples. Practically, PRISM permits multiple pathways for pluralistic AI [43]: exploring personalised and steerable alignment using detailed profiles on the participant matched to their specific feedback and reward signals [2, 3]; and designing approaches\n\n<sup>28</sup>We consider preference falsification or measurement errors separately in \u00a7 5.2\n\nfor distributional or collective alignment, using multiple perspectives or principles across people to generate consensus [4, 5] or learn from a distribution of rewards [33, 7, 6]. Participation often has this paradox of what Kelty [46] calls *contributory autonomy*, that can tend towards \"an alienated individuality, for instance, or identification with a particular collective\" [46] (p.23). We do not see these pathways as antagonistic\u2014prioritising and emphasising individual subjectivity does not preclude finding common grounds on important development decisions for AI [77, 150, 151]\u2014nor exhaustive, because alignment (as dependent on values and morals that emerge intersubjectively) can exist somewhere between individuals and sociological wholes [152, 153]. PRISM permits modelling of both individual and collective preference, but asking individuals to deliberate their priorities in groups may yield different outcomes than gathering data from one person at a time [5, 115, 154].\n\nParticipation-washing and intended impact In our setting, we claim what Sloane et al. [48] calls *participation as work*, that is offering fair remuneration and attribution of the consensual labour of workers contributing to our project. Notably, many participants (those familiar and unfamiliar with AI) contacted the researchers and reported enjoying or learning from the task, suggesting there was an \"education quotient\" or role of *participation as experience* [46]. Our aims do evoke notions of *participation as justice*\u2014including more people at the table of LLM design and development\u2014but participation is in reality thin, because while we seek their view, we cannot grant participants the power to change behaviours of deployed LLMs [155]. Even the etymological roots of participation centre on the notion of \"sharing\" [46] but there is no guarantee that the human workers upon whom the success of RLHF relies on, partake in any share of the profits from more usable or preferred LLM technologies. We release PRISM in the hope it moves the needle towards more inclusive and diverse research on human-AI interactions, emphasising the central role of those who contribute their time and voice to generating human feedback data. Ultimately, how these contributions have impact depends on those in power (industry labs, academics, policymakers), because \"the experience of participation must include the sense not only of having spoken, but of having been heard\" [p.18, 46].\n\n### 5.1 Ethical Considerations\n\nPrivacy and deanonymisation The conversations in PRISM are highly personal, for example detailing views towards abortion, religion, immigration, workplace disputes or intimate relationships. We have pseudo-anonymised the data, checked for PII (App. E), sought informed consent from every participant (App. D), provided options for participants to withdraw their data, and clearly stipulated that attempts of deanonymisation violate our dataset's terms and conditions (App. C). However, despite following these best practices, the risk for deanonymisation remains. We include a reporting mechanism on our website and GitHub for any participants and researchers to report issues.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [2] Hannah Rose Kirk, Bertie Vidgen, Paul R\u00f6ttger, and Scott A.

Su\u2021 Zhiwei Steven Wu\u00a7 Linjun Zhang\u00b6\n\n#### Abstract\n\nReinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) is an emerging paradigm to align models with human preferences. Typically, RLHF aggregates preferences from multiple individuals who have diverse viewpoints that may conflict with each other. Our work initiates the theoretical study of multi-party RLHF that explicitly models the diverse preferences of multiple individuals. We show how traditional RLHF approaches can fail since learning a single reward function cannot capture and balance the preferences of multiple individuals. To overcome such limitations, we incorporate meta-learning to learn multiple preferences and adopt different social welfare functions to aggregate the preferences across multiple parties. We focus on the offline learning setting and establish sample complexity bounds, along with efficiency and fairness guarantees, for optimizing diverse social welfare functions such as Nash, Utilitarian, and Leximin welfare functions. Our results show a separation between the sample complexities of multi-party RLHF and traditional single-party RLHF. Furthermore, we consider a reward-free setting, where each individual's preference is no longer consistent with a reward model, and give pessimistic variants of the von Neumann Winner based on offline preference data. Taken together, our work showcases the advantage of multi-party RLHF but also highlights its more demanding statistical complexity.\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nRecent advancements in AI alignment focus on training AI systems to align with user preferences. A prevalent strategy involves integrating human feedback into the learning process, a technique that has significantly influenced the development of language models and reinforcement learning among other areas (Ouyang et al., 2022; Ziegler et al., 2019). Established RLHF methods typically fit a reward model over users' preferences data (in the form of pairwise comparisons) and then train policies to optimize the learned reward. The implicit assumption behind this approach is that different users preferences can be modeled via a single reward function.\n\nHowever, this type of single-party reward-based assumption is at odds with the fact that users may possess heterogeneous viewpoints that conflict with each other. For example, the nature of human opinion in open-ended social decision-making scenarios is inherently diverse and dynamic, making traditional reinforcement learning from\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup>Peking University.

Email: linjun.zhang@rutgers.edu\n\nhuman feedback (RLHF) models (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022) insufficient. To see how traditional single-party RLHF can fail to balance multiple individuals' preferences, consider the following toy example.\n\nExample (2 parties and 3 alternatives). Consider a scenario where users have preferences over three options A, B, C. Half of the population prefers A \u227b C \u227b B (with underlying rewards of R1(A) = 1, R1(C) = 1\u2212\u01eb, R1(B) = 0 for some \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1)), while the other half prefers B \u227b C \u227b A (with underlying rewards of R2(B) = 1, R2(C) = 1\u2212\u01eb, R2(A) = 0). Then pooling both sub-populations' preferences together, we cannot differentiate between A, B, C via pairwise comparison. Thus, if we learn a single reward function R over the pooled pairwise comparison data, the resulting R will have R(A) = R(B) = R(C). This leads to a policy that selects the three options uniformly at random, which has an average reward less than 2/3. However, if we learn each sub-population's reward separately, we can potentially arrive at a better policy that only recommends option B and achieves an average reward of 1\u2212\u01eb.\n\nThis tension between the traditional single-party (or single-reward) RLHF approach and diverse users preferences motivates the following question:\n\n#### How can models be trained to align with the preferences of heterogeneous individuals?\n\n# Provable Multi-Party Reinforcement Learning with Diverse Human Feedback\n\nOur work takes a step towards addressing this question by initiating a theoretical exploration of multi-party RLHF, that aims to explicitly model and balance diverse heterogeneous preferences from different individuals. We take inspiration from social choice theory (Jin et al., 2020; Noothigattu et al., 2020), which offers an extensive array of tools for aggregating human preferences. At a high level, we extend the framework of RLHF to directly accommodate multiple parties and heterogeneous preferences by utilizing social welfare functions. We focus on offline learning with the goal of learning a policy from offline preference data. We start from the CB setting with pairwise comparisons and later generalize to the Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our primary focus is on the popular offline setting, where the dataset is pre-collected. The insights of our approaches can be generalized to a wider range of scenarios. Notably, recent works by Zhu et al. (2023) and Zhan et al. (2023) provided an initial theoretical analysis of offline RLHF. Our paper takes a step further by considering cases with multiple parties and heterogeneous preferences.\n\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n- We propose a general framework for alignment with multiple heterogeneous parties. We utilize a meta-learning technique to learn individual rewards, and aggregate them using Nash's social welfare function based on the confidence bounds on reward estimation. We further extend our analyses for the Utilitarian and Leximin welfare functions.\n- We provide sample complexity bounds for obtaining an approximately optimal policy through our proposed framework. We further introduce efficiency and fairness definitions and demonstrate the learned policies satisfy approximate Pareto efficiency and Pigou-Dalton principle, thus ensuring the collective welfare and avoiding inequality or dominance.\n- We extend our analysis to a reward-free setting, where individual preferences are no longer consistent with a certain data generative model. We provide pessimistic variants of von Neumann winner (Fishburn, 1984), determined by the confidence bounds on preference distributions. Theoretical guarantees of sample complexity and ex-post efficiency are also provided in this generalized setting.\n\nThe novelty of our work lies in two aspects. First, we employ a meta-learning technique for learning multiple reward functions from limited observations, by utilizing a common feature representation among various parties. This strategy enhances learning efficiency in environments where data are scarce, drawing on the foundational work in few-shot learning (Du et al., 2020; Tripuraneni et al., 2020). Second, we integrate a pessimistic approach within social welfare functions to guarantee model invariance with the inclusion of zero rewards in the presence of multiple parties. This aspect of our work extends the principles established by Zhu et al. (2023), where we establish a sub-optimality bound for the (Nash's) social welfare function. This bound is derived by aggregating heterogeneous individual rewards, necessitating a more stringent data coverage condition than what is typically required in RLHF scenarios involving a single entity.\n\n### 2 Related Work\n\nMeta-learning Meta-learning, or learning to learn, seeks to design a learner to quickly learn new tasks based on a few prior tasks. Some of the dominant approaches learn a common representation among multiple tasks, referred to as representation learning (Baxter, 2000; Finn et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2023; Maurer et al., 2016). Theoretical guarantees for multi-task linear regression with low-dimensional linear representation have been established in the literature (Du et al., 2020; Li and Zhang, 2023; Tripuraneni et al., 2020). Our work contributes to generalizing this line of work, by investigating the learning-to-learn abilities in human preference-based models with a more complicated structure.\nSource 6:\n# arXiv:2403.18185v1 [econ.TH] 27 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n# Learning Optimal Behavior Through Reasoning and Experiences\u2217\n\nCosmin Ilut Duke University & NBER\n\nRosen Valchev Boston College & NBER\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\n### Abstract\n\nWe develop a novel framework of bounded rationality under cognitive frictions that studies learning over optimal behavior through both deliberative reasoning and accumulated experiences. Using both types of information, agents engage in Bayesian non-parametric estimation of the unknown action value function.

Agents' subjective estimation uncertainty, which evolves through information accumulation, modulates the two modes of learning in a state- and history-dependent way. We discuss how the model draws on and bridges conceptual, methodological and empirical insights from both economics and the cognitive sciences literature on reinforcement learning.\n\nJEL Codes: D83, D91, E21, E71, C11\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup>We thank Sam Gershman for extensive and helpful discussions.

Across both economics and cognitive sciences, the literature recognizes two broad ways in which people learn about and deduce what is the best course of action in a given situation. The first is cognition and reasoning: through introspective, abstract deliberations, humans can get a better grasp of what is their optimal action in the situation at hand. The second is accumulated experiences: by observing realized outcomes of past decisions, agents update their views on the respective benefits of taking those actions in these circumstances. These two sources of information are conceptually distinct and are both limited: experiences are observed only along the realized path of situations the agent actually faced in the past, and while abstract thinking could help the agent deduce outcomes in counterfactual actions and situations, such deliberations are cognitively costly.\n\nThis paper develops a novel framework of constrained-optimal behavior under cognitive frictions that studies jointly learning through reasoning and accumulated experiences. To do so, the paper draws on conceptual, methodological and empirical insights from both economics and the cognitive sciences literature on reinforcement learning (RL) (Kaelbling et al. (1996), Sutton and Barto (2018)).\n\nIn our framework, agents are uncertain about optimal behavior in the sense of facing subjective uncertainty over the optimal policy and value functions that characterize their decision problem. In particular, we follow the RL approach of letting agents learn about the action value function Q\u03c0(a, s), which gives the expected discounted sum of utility when taking action a in state s and following a given policy \u03c0(a|s) thereafter.1 While the standard approach in economics is to endow the agents with perfect knowledge about the optimal policy function \u03c0 \u2217 (a|s) and therefore the action value function Q\u03c0\u2217 (a, s), in our model agents perceive Q\u03c0\u2217 (a, s) as uncertain ex-ante, and gradually learn about it over time.\n\nLearning can occur through cognition, which is costly, but beneficial in reducing agents' uncertainty about the best course of action. Agents trade off that benefit and cost of engaging cognitive resources, giving rise to a state- and history- dependent choice of reasoning and thus exhibit constrained-optimal, or \"resource-rational\" behavior. Agents also update beliefs about optimal behavior based on the experienced flow utility each period. Critically, the effective precision of both reasoning and experiences in informing behavior is endogenous, as a function of the agent's beginning of period prior beliefs and uncertainty which evolve dynamically and endogenously.\n\n<sup>1</sup> In the language of RL, this \"action\" value function is closely related and derived from the \"state\" value function V (s) which is perhaps more familiar to economists.\n\nElements of framework. There are four key specific features of our learning framework.\n\nFirst, we model agents' beliefs over the unknown function Q\u03c0\u2217 (a, s) as a Gaussian Process (GP) distribution.2 On the one hand, the GP distribution is methodologically appealing as a prior over the space of functions, as it is very flexible, and also tractable in recursively characterizing the conditional moments of the unknown function.3 On the other hand, cognitive sciences increasingly emphasizes a Bayesian approach and in particular the appeal of GP distributions, both for conceptual and descriptive reasons.4\n\nSecond, given an estimate of the action value function Qbt(a, s), agents take constrained optimal actions trading off exploitation and experimentation incentives. On the one hand, the agent has incentives to choose the action with the highest estimated value Qbt(a, st) at the current state st (exploitation). On the other hand, the agent recognizes that Qbt(a, st) is just an uncertain estimate so there is a benefit to exploration and learning more about the unknown Q\u03c0\u2217 (a, s). We model this desire for experimentation following the concept of maximum entropy reinforcement learning, which essentially the entropy of the action distribution to be bigger than some minimum threshold, thus ensuring randomization.5 In contrast to the standard approach that sets this minimum threshold as an exogenous time-invariant parameter, we let the entropy lower bound be proportional to the remaining subjective uncertainty over Q\u03c0\u2217 (a, st). This captures the intuition that experimentation is valuable only to the extent that the Q-function is uncertain. Putting it all together, the resulting optimal action policy function takes the form of the softmax function widely used in statistics and machine learning (see eg. Sutton and Barto (2018)).\nSource 7:\nAbstract:Conveying complex objectives to reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires meticulous reward engineering. Preference-based RL methods are able to learn a more flexible reward model based on human preferences by actively incorporating human feedback, i.e. teacher's preferences between two clips of behaviors. However, poor feedback-efficiency still remains a problem in current preference-based RL algorithms, as tailored human feedback is very expensive. To handle this issue, previous methods have mainly focused on improving query selection and policy initialization. At the same time, recent exploration methods have proven to be a recipe for improving sample-efficiency in RL. We present an exploration method specifically for preference-based RL algorithms. Our main idea is to design an intrinsic reward by measuring the novelty based on learned reward. Specifically, we utilize disagreement across ensemble of learned reward models. Our intuition is that disagreement in learned reward model reflects uncertainty in tailored human feedback and could be useful for exploration. Our experiments show that exploration bonus from uncertainty in learned reward improves both feedback- and sample-efficiency of preference-based RL algorithms on complex robot manipulation tasks from MetaWorld benchmarks, compared with other existing exploration methods that measure the novelty of state visitation.\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?Learn more about arXivLabs.\narXiv Operational StatusGet status notifications viaemailorslack\nSource 8:\nGiancarlo Pallavicini, born in Desio, Italy, on February 12, 1931, is a distinguished economist, academic, and writer.

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to develop a formal specification for an embedded agency solution that tackles three main issues: optimization boundaries, self-reference, and logical uncertainty. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand each problem individually before considering how they fit together in the solution.\n\nStarting with Optimization Boundaries: These are situations where decisions can't be consistently optimized because there's inherent uncertainty about which approach is best. For example, choosing between AI development and model training when both have possible risks. How do we handle this? Maybe using a utility function that factors in risk and reward. But I need to define what \"optimization\" means here\u2014maybe it's maximizing some expected value.\n\nNext, Self-Reference: This is where the solution refers to itself, leading to paradoxes like Epistemic Paradox. The problem arises because the agent can't know its own decision-making process. So, perhaps using a fixed point approach or an iterative method that converges despite self-referential steps. It should handle situations where the model's understanding loops back on itself.\n\nLogical Uncertainty: This is when agents don't have complete information about logical truths, like in cases of unknown probability distributions. The solution needs to manage uncertainty without being certain it's handled. Maybe using a method that models possible worlds or uses probabilistic logic. It should avoid overconfidence in uncertain situations.\n\nPutting it all together, the solution must address each problem simultaneously. How? Perhaps integrating these elements into a unified framework where each component contributes to addressing its own issues while working together on the third.\n\nI need to define terms clearly:\n\n- **Optimization**: Quantifying the trade-off between risk and return.\n- **Self-Reference**: Managing loops in decision-making that refer back to themselves, possibly using fixed points or dynamic programming.\n- **Logical Uncertainty**: Handling unknown probabilities by considering multiple possible worlds or models where different logical truths hold.\n\nThe specification should outline each of these with formal definitions. Maybe start with the overall objective\u2014maximizing expected utility across all uncertainties and loops. Then define how each problem is addressed, ensuring they are integrated into a single solution.\n\nI also need to consider the structure:\n\n1. **Problem Definitions**: Precisely define what optimization boundaries, self-reference, and logical uncertainty mean in this context.\n2. **Integrated Approach**: Propose a method that combines these elements without contradiction. Perhaps using probabilistic decision trees or Bayesian networks for optimization, iterative methods for self-reference, and possible-worlds models for logical uncertainty.\n3. **Algorithm Design**: Outline the steps the agent takes to process information, evaluate options, update beliefs, and make decisions.\n4. **Formal Language**: Use precise terms and mathematical constructs where necessary.\n5. **Handling Uncertainty**: Emphasize robustness against ambiguity, imprecision, and lack of knowledge by employing methods that account for these uncertainties.\n\nWait, am I missing anything? Maybe the interaction between self-reference and logical uncertainty. Perhaps ensuring that when an agent is in a loop, it can iteratively refine its understanding without getting stuck, leveraging techniques from self-reference that converge or use fixed points appropriately.\n\nAlso, how does the agent handle different types of uncertainties (optimization, self-reference, logical)? It should integrate methods for each, treating them as complementary rather than competing issues. For example, using multiple utility functions that weigh different aspects of risk and reward when optimization boundaries are at play.\n\nI think I have a rough outline in my head. Now, time to structure this into formal terms.\n</think>\n\n### Formal Specification for an Embedded Agency Solution: Addressing Optimization Boundaries, Self-Reference, and Logical Uncertainty\n\n**1. Problem Definitions**\n\n- **Optimization Boundaries**: Situations where decisions cannot be consistently optimized due to uncertainty about the best approach (e.g., AI vs. model training). addressed by defining a utility function that balances risk and reward.\n  \n- **Self-Reference**: Loops in decision-making referring back to themselves, leading to paradoxes like Epistemic Paradox. Addressed using fixed points or iterative methods.\n  \n- **Logical Uncertainty**: Unknown probabilities about logical truths (e.g., unknown probability distributions). Handled by considering multiple possible worlds via possible-worlds models.\n\n**2. Integrated Approach**\n\nThe solution is structured as follows:\n\n1. **Optimization Framework**: Utilize a utility function that quantifies trade-offs between risk and return, optimizing expected utility across all uncertainties.\n\n2. **Iterative Decision-Making**: Employ iterative methods to manage self-reference by converging on fixed points or updating beliefs dynamically.\n\n3. **Possible-Worlds Model**: Model uncertainty in logical truths using models where different truth values hold, ensuring robustness against ambiguity.\n\n**3. Algorithm Design**\n\n- **Information Processing**: The agent processes information step-by-step, evaluating each option's expected utility.\n  \n- **Decision Making**: Choose the option maximizing the expected utility, accounting for all uncertainties and loops.\n\n- **Belief Update**: Use Bayesian networks or similar methods to iteratively update beliefs based on new information.\n\n**4. Handling Uncertainty**\n\n- **Ambiguity and Imprecision**: Treat uncertainty with methods that account for lack of knowledge, avoiding overconfidence.\n  \n- **Lack of Knowledge**: Consider multiple possible truth values in logical models, ensuring comprehensive coverage without contradiction.\n\nThis specification ensures the embedded agency solution integrates each problem's challenges, providing a robust framework capable of handling optimization boundaries, self-reference, and logical uncertainty simultaneously."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to develop a formal specification for an embedded agency solution. The user wants it to address three main problems: optimization boundary, self-reference, and logical uncertainty. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, optimization boundaries. From what I remember, these are the points where human judgment meets algorithmic processing in AI systems. So the solution should be designed to balance both, ensuring that algorithms don't become too deterministic while humans can still contribute optimally. Maybe I'll need a way to detect and adapt between human decision-making phases.\n\nNext, self-reference. That sounds tricky because it's when something refers to itself, which can lead to paradoxes or logical issues. For example, an AI might refer to its own beliefs in a confusing way. The solution should ensure that the AI doesn't end up in loops where it constantly references itself without making progress. Perhaps using formal logic to check self-referential statements for consistency would help.\n\nLastly, logical uncertainty. This is when an AI's predictions are inherently uncertain and can't be precisely determined due to computational limits or lack of information. The solution needs a mechanism to handle this uncertainty by providing a probability distribution over possible outcomes rather than definitive answers. Maybe incorporating probabilistic reasoning in the algorithm where it makes decisions based on available data.\n\nNow, putting this together into a formal specification. I should define each of these objectives and then outline how they are addressed within the system. Let's see:\n\nObjective 1: Optimization Boundary\n- The solution must handle situations where human judgment meets algorithmic processing.\n- It needs to detect boundaries and adapt between phases.\n- Maybe using AI decision-making models, but periodically consulting with humans to adjust.\n\nObjective 2: Self-Reference\n- Ensure that the system doesn't reference itself in a way that causes paradoxes.\n- Implement formal verification of self-referential statements.\n- Perhaps using automated tools or frameworks for logical consistency checks.\n\nObjective 3: Logical Uncertainty\n- Allow the AI to provide probabilistic outputs where determinism is impossible.\n- Integrate probabilistic reasoning into decision-making processes.\n- Use algorithms that handle uncertainty by providing probability distributions rather than certainties.\n\nI should also think about how these objectives interact. For instance, handling self-reference might affect optimization boundaries because if an AI relies too much on its own beliefs, it could become rigid without proper human intervention. Similarly, logical uncertainty could potentially undermine optimization if the system's decisions aren't probabilistic enough.\n\nMaybe integrating these objectives into a single framework where each part contributes to the overall solution. Perhaps using a hybrid approach where AI handles most deterministic tasks but consults humans for self-referential and uncertain cases.\n\nI should also outline the architecture of the embedded agency. Probably having multiple modules or components, each handling one objective. For example, one module for optimization, another for self-reference, and a third for logical uncertainty. They could interact to ensure all objectives are met simultaneously.\n\nTesting would be crucial here. I need to test how the system handles changes in human interaction, self-referential loops, and unpredictable uncertainties. Maybe include scenarios where humans switch roles or adjust their influence on the AI based on feedback.\n\nPotential challenges include ensuring seamless integration of human judgment into the algorithmic processes without overwhelming it with data. Also, automating checks for logical consistency could be complex but necessary to maintain reliability.\n\nI think I have a good grasp now. Time to structure this into a formal specification.\n</think>\n\n**Formal Specification for Embedded Agency Solution**\n\n**Objective 1: Optimization Boundary**\n\n- **Definition**: The balance between human judgment and algorithmic processing in AI systems at the point where both interact optimally.\n  \n- **Addressed by**: \n  - Implement AI decision models that adapt dynamically.\n  - Periodically consult humans to adjust balances, preventing determinism from overshadowing optimal human contributions.\n\n**Objective 2: Self-Reference**\n\n- **Definition**: Reframing statements within the system about itself, leading to logical inconsistencies or paradoxes.\n  \n- **Addressed by**: \n  - Employ formal logic frameworks for verification.\n  - Use automated tools and systems to check self-referential consistency, preventing logical loops.\n\n**Objective 3: Logical Uncertainty**\n\n- **Definition**: Inherent uncertainty in predictions due to limited data or computational limits.\n  \n- **Addressed by**: \n  - Integrate probabilistic reasoning into decision-making processes.\n  - Use algorithms that provide probability distributions for outcomes, reflecting uncertainty without certainty.\n\n**Architectural Structure**\n\n- **Modules**: \n  - AI Module: Handles deterministic tasks with algorithms.\n  - Human Interaction Module: Processes human judgments.\n  - Logical Uncertainty Module: Manages probabilistic outputs.\n\n- **Interactions**: Modules work together to balance optimization, self-reference, and uncertainty.

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to design an experimental protocol that can differentiate between three different theories: Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Higher-Order Thought Theory (HOTT), and Integrated Information Theory (IIT). These are all theories about consciousness and how it works in the brain. But wait, actually integrating these into a neural network? Hmm, that might be tricky because they're all mental models or explanations.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand each theory individually to see what aspects they focus on. GWT is about the whole environment as a workspace where people are focused on specific tasks without distractions. It emphasizes task organization and spatial-temporal awareness. HOTT, if I remember correctly, involves the brain's ability to generate a higher-order consciousness by creating abstract structures in memory. Integrated Information Theory, I think, is about how much information a system retains when it's at maximum integration, so that would relate to consciousness as an integrated state.\n\nBut all these theories are mental models used to explain consciousness, and applying them directly to neural networks might not work because they're abstract. So maybe the approach should be more empirical rather than theoretical. That makes me think of experiments done in neuroscientific studies where specific brain areas or neural processes are manipulated to observe their functional roles.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned designing a protocol to distinguish between these theories within the framework of large-scale neural networks. Maybe they're looking for an experimental setup that examines how different aspects of consciousness manifest at the neural level using GWT, HOTT, and IIT as guides.\n\nI should think about what each theory would predict in terms of neural activity. For example, GWT might predict specific patterns of brain activation when people are focused on a task without distractions. HOTT could involve complex network interactions that lead to abstract thought generation. IIT might suggest high levels of integration and information processing necessary for consciousness.\n\nSo perhaps the experimental protocol would involve measuring different aspects of neural activity across these theories. For instance, using functional MRI (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG) to observe brain activation in real-time while participants engage in tasks under each theory's conditions. Then, analyze the patterns of activity to see how they differ.\n\nBut wait, the user wants a protocol that distinguishes between these theories, not just measure them. Maybe it should test predictions from each theory and see which one fits better with observable neural data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the experiment would involve creating or inducing specific conditions where participants are exposed to different types of mental tasks, and then observe how their brain activity aligns with GWT, HOTT, or IIT.\n\nWait, maybe another angle is that these theories might be modeled in a way that can be tested within neural networks. For example, using specific brain regions to represent different aspects of consciousness as per each theory.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here because I'm mixing theoretical models with experimental methods. Since the user mentioned large-scale neural networks, maybe the experiment would involve testing how these theories explain observed neural activity patterns in complex networks.\n\nPerhaps the protocol would include multiple conditions where participants are exposed to different types of tasks\u2014like cognitive puzzles or memory challenges\u2014and then observe how their brain regions react under each condition as per GWT, HOTT, and IIT. By comparing the activation patterns across these conditions, one could see which theory better explains the observed neural responses.\n\nBut again, this is getting a bit abstract because all three theories are mental models. How do we apply them to actual experimental setups? Maybe by structuring experiments where each condition tests what each theory would predict in terms of brain function and activation patterns.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how GWT can be applied at the neural level without some sort of experimental framework. It's more about environments, so perhaps a task that isolates different functional domains under various conditions is needed. Similarly, HOTT might involve generating abstract structures, which could be tested by tasks that require creating mental abstractions or higher-order thoughts.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is to use an experimental protocol within the framework of large-scale neural networks that test each theory's predictions. That means setting up specific conditions where participants engage in activities designed to highlight how GWT, HOTT, and IIT would predict different brain dynamics.\n\nIn summary, the protocol should involve designing tasks or conditions that can be measured using neuroscientific tools (fMRI, EEG), observe the resulting neural activity patterns, and then compare these patterns against what each theoretical model predicts. The theory that aligns best with the observed patterns is the one that better explains consciousness in this context.\n</think>\n\nTo design an experimental protocol for distinguishing between Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Higher-Order Thought Theory (HOTT), and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) within large-scale neural networks, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Theories' Predictions**: \n   - **GWT**: Focus on task organization and spatial-temporal awareness in a focused environment.\n   - **HOTT**: Highlight the generation of abstract structures to create higher-order consciousness.\n   - **IIT**: Emphasize maximum integration of information necessary for consciousness.\n\n2. **Select Neuroscientific Tools**:\n   - Use functional MRI (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activation in real-time during experimental tasks.\n\n3. **Design Experimental Conditions**:\n   - Create tasks that isolate different functional domains as predicted by each theory.\n     - GWT: Engage participants in cognitive puzzles and memory challenges without distractions.\n     - HOTT: Instruct participants in abstract reasoning or problem-solving sessions requiring mental abstractions.\n     - IIT: Introduce complex tasks where high integration of information is essential.\n\n4. **Observe Neural Activity**:\n   - Measure brain activation patterns using fMRI/EEG to observe how each condition affects neural activity.\n\n5. **Compare Observations with Theories**:\n   - Analyze the observed neural responses under GWT, HOTT, and IIT conditions.\n   - Identify which theory best explains the pattern of neural activity in each task.\n\n6. **Draw Conclusions**:\n   - Determine which theoretical framework aligns most closely with the experimental data, thereby distinguishing between them within a neural network context.\n\nThis protocol uses empirical methods to test theoretical predictions within a neuroscientific framework, helping to distinguish consciousness explanations through observed brain dynamics."

But I'm not exactly sure where to start. Let me see... The user mentioned something about dynamics at different scales\u2014local, medium, global\u2014so maybe that's important.\n\nI remember that in physics, metastable states are those systems that stay in a certain state until conditions change. Like if you heat water and it boils, the liquid is metastable until you reach the boiling point. Metastability in the brain must be similar but on a much larger scale, right?\n\nSo, the brain isn't just doing what's happening now; it's also thinking about the future or remembering things. I've heard of attractors before\u2014it was something with attractors and different states. Maybe metastable states are like these attractors that represent different mental states? Like when you're happy, calm, scared... each a separate state.\n\nThe user mentioned how the brain works at three levels: local, medium, global. Local is immediate reactions, medium involves more complex thoughts, and global is conscious awareness. So, metastable would be those states where the brain is in one mental state until something changes it. Like when you're thinking about a problem but then decide to calm down.\n\nIn the user's explanation, metastable dynamics are continuous and have long-term memory. That makes sense because if you're in a stable state for a while, maybe that's how we remember things over time\u2014staying focused until something changes.\n\nI'm still a bit fuzzy on examples though. Maybe looking at sleep? When I sleep, I don't really feel tired until I wake up, right? So different states emerge as I go through the night\u2014like not so tired (maybe local state), then tired, and then awake. So that's metastable in my mind.\n\nWhat about learning? When a child learns a new word, it goes from being just heard to understood. That seems like switching between states\u2014maybe an initial less stable state where it's just memorized, then transitioned to a more stable state where it makes sense.\n\nThe user also talked about attractors in cognitive processes and attractor networks. I think attractors are like the patterns our brains settle into when they're thinking or reacting. So, even if someone changes their mind, they might return to a previous state because it's an attractor.\n\nIn the global workspace, the user mentioned it's related to long-range connections and signals. So maybe that's where decisions happen across different brain regions at once, leading to new states. That would explain how sometimes people make big life choices or deal with problems that affect multiple areas simultaneously.\n\nThe user also touched on functional connectivity between different brain regions. If those are dynamically connected, maybe switching focus happens when these connections change, shifting the metastable state.\n\nAnother thought: metastability could be about how the brain handles stress or emergencies. You might go through various stable states until you're ready to act\u2014like calm (state 1), stressed (state 2), and then ready for action (state 3).\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. Maybe it's more about different mental states being maintained over time, which affects how we perceive emotions or thoughts. It could also relate to decision-making processes where the brain keeps several possibilities in mind until information changes.\n\nI think I need to break it down into parts: metastable states at local, medium, global scales, their relation to attractors and long-term memory, examples of different states in daily life, how they transition between these states, and maybe some physical models or mathematical representations. That should give me a clearer picture.\n</think>\n\nMetastability is a concept that describes systems in dynamical equilibrium across multiple scales\u2014local, medium, and global\u2014and illustrates the transitions between stable states. Here's an organized overview:\n\n1. **Definition and Scales**:\n   - metastable states are found at local (immediate), medium (complex thoughts), and global (conscious awareness) scales.\n   - These states represent different mental or physiological conditions.\n\n2. **Examples in Daily Life**:\n   - Sleep: Different states emerge as you transition through the night, maintaining focus until a change occurs.\n   - Learning: Shifts from initial memorization to comprehension across various brain regions.\n\n3. **Attractors and Long-Term Memory**:\n   - Metastable states can be attractors that guide long-term memories; systems stay in these states long-term before transitioning.\n   - Sleep exemplifies this with different states guiding sleep patterns.\n\n4. **Cognitive Processes**:\n   - Processing involves transitions between states, such as moving from comprehension to analysis or decision-making.\n   - Attractors in cognitive processes influence how information is remembered and processed.\n\n5. **Global Workspace Dynamics**:\n   - Global workspace explains long-range signal flow and long-term connectivity changes, leading to altered mindfulness states.\n   - Tackles can involve multiple regions simultaneously, shifting the metastable state.\n\n6. **Functional Connectivity and Transitions**:\n   - Dynamic connections between brain regions facilitate transitions between metastable states.\n   - Stress or emergencies might trigger transitions from calm (state 1) to stressed (state 2) to ready for action (state 3).\n\n7. **Mathematical and Physical Models**:\n   - Concepts like attractors and long-term memory are mathematically modeled, with neural networks exhibiting metastable states.\n\nIn summary, metastability involves maintaining multiple mental or physical states across scales, transitioning between these states in daily life examples, influenced by attractors, and characterized by dynamic brain connections.",

We are particularly interested in the interactions between stimulus category and task-relevance, as well as between stimulus duration and task-relevance. Trial numbers, stimulus randomization and timing parameters are optimized for the different methodologies i.e., fMRI, M-EEG and iEEG. Technique specific details are described in the preregistration in OSF.\nFor the fMRI and M-EEG studies, all participants will be older than 18 years old, have reportedly normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and no known history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. For the iEEG studies, subjects will be 10\u201365 years old, be able to provide informed consent, have IQ > 70, be fluent in English or Spanish, self-reported normal hearing, normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and show cognitive and language abilities within or above the normal range in formal neuropsychological testing performed before surgery and must not have had an electrographic seizure within 3-hours prior to testing. When available, information concerning language dominance as assessed by the intracarotid sodium amobarbital (Wada) will be reported.\nInformed consent will be obtained prior to the study. In the case of minors, assent will be obtained from the minor and informed consent will be obtained from a parent or a legal guardian. IRB approval has been obtained from each local site in which the experiments are being conducted. Patients will be informed that participation in the study will not affect their clinical care and that they could withdraw their participation from the study at any point without affecting their clinical care. All subjects will be informed that data will be made publicly available for a minimum of 5 years after the publication of the main results. Only subjects agreeing to the data sharing procedure will be recruited.\nTargeted sample sizes were determined for each methodology as being 2.5 times larger than common sample sizes in the literature for that methodology (50 subjects for fMRI and for M-EEG given that 20 subjects is the common sample size; 25 subjects for iEEG given that 10 subjects is the common sample size). Samples sizes refer to total data that will be collected in each individual laboratory, i.e., total sample sizes when the data is combined across labs will be one hundred for fMRI, one hundred for M-EEG, and fifty for iEEG. We estimate a 20% attrition related to data quality. Even after considering attrition, since we will use a within-subject design, this sample size will give us >90% power to detect differences of medium effect size (Cohen\u2019s d = >0.5).\nThe data will be analyzed by the data monitoring team (who are not part of the data acquisition labs) to ensure data quality. This will be done both behaviorally, aimed at excluding subjects who do not meet our predefined criteria (see below), and physiologically, to test data quality (e.g., by assessing signal to noise ratio in the neural data, eye movement patterns in the eye tracking data, etc.). These data quality checks are orthogonal to the tested predictions by the theories. We will stop collecting data upon completing the predefined sample size. No further rejection of subjects will occur after this stage.\nThe exclusion criteria will include: (a) insufficient number of trials in each of the experimental conditions, due to excessive eye movements, muscular artifacts, movement, noisy recording, or subjects deciding to stop the experiments (<30 for M-EEG or <20 for fMRI. If analyses show that a good enough signal can be obtained with fewer trials, these numbers will be amended); and (b) low performance in the attention tasks. In Experiment 1, this translates into: <80% hits, >20% FAs for fMRI and M-EEG subjects; <70% hits, >30% FAs for iEEG patients. For Experiment 2 performance criteria, see below.\nBased on the opposing predictions of the theories, we will focus on testing three predictions. The first refers todecodability of content of consciousness(see analysis #1 below). Decoding will be tested for category as well as for orientation (which is a task irrelevant feature, because\u2013as opposed to category\u2013it is completely orthogonal to the task). As the stimuli are clearly visible in this experiment, the theories predict that information about the content of consciousness should be consistently found in the underlying neural substrates, even if the stimulus (or one of its features, like orientation) is task-irrelevant. Thus, according to GNW, such information should be found in nodes of prefrontal areas, while according to IIT it should be primarily found in posterior areas. The critical test of these predictions will accordingly be whether decoding of category and orientation generalizes from the task relevant (non-target) condition to the task irrelevant condition, within the predicted brain regions (PFC for GNW versus posterior hot zone for IIT). The second prediction refers to themaintenance of a percept over time, manipulated here via\nSource 2:\n# **Notes**\n\n*Rob Long has been working on this issue:* For an initial discussion, see Robert Long, Key questions about artificial sentience: An opinionated guide. *Experience Machines (Substack),* 2022.\n\n*Recurrent processing theory:* Victor A.

One can likewise take theory-heavy, theory-neutral, and theory-light approaches to AI consciousness. The approach to artificial consciousness that I have taken here is distinct from these three. It might be considered a *theory-balanced* approach: proceed by balancing one's credences between various theories, perhaps according to evidence for those theories or according to acceptance of those theories.\n\nA more precise form of the theory-balanced approach might use data about how widely accepted various theories are among experts to provide credences for those theories, and use those credences along with the various theories' predictions to estimate probabilities for AI (or animal) consciousness. In a recent survey of researchers in the science of consciousness (Jolien C. Frankel et al, \"An academic survey on theoretical foundations, common assumptions and the current state of consciousness science\", *Neuroscience of Consciousness,* issue 1, 2022), just over 50% indicated that they accept or find promising the global workspace theory of consciousness, while just under 50% indicated that they accept or find promising the local recurrence theory (which requires recurrent processing for consciousness). Figures for other theories include just over 50% for predictive processing theories (which do not make clear predictions for AI consciousness) and for higher-order theories (which require self-models for consciousness), and just under 50% for integrated information theory (which ascribes consciousness to many simple systems but requires recurrent processing for consciousness). Of course turning these figures into collective credences requires further work (e.g. in converting \"accept\" and \"find promising\" into credences), as does applying these credences along with theoretical predictions to derive collective credences about AI consciousness. Still, it seems not unreasonable to assign a collective credence of well over 25% for each of global workspace, recurrent processing, and self-models as requirements for consciousness.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in a 2020 survey of professional philosophers (David Bourget and David Chalmers, \"Philosophers on Philosophy: The 2020 PhilPapers Survey\", *Philosophers' Imprint,* 2023), around 3% accepted or leaned toward the view that current AI systems are conscious, with 82% rejecting or leaning against the view and 10% neutral. Around 39% accepted or leaned toward the view that future AI systems will be conscious, with 27% rejecting or leaning against the view and 29% neutral. (Around 5% rejected the questions in various ways, e.g. saying that there is no fact of the matter or that the question is too unclear to answer). The future-AI figures might tend to suggest a collective credence of at least 25% that biology is required for consciousness (albeit in a different group). The two surveys have less information about unified agency and about sensory grounding as requirements for consciousness.\nSource 3:\nAn official website of the United States government\nOfficial websites use .govA.govwebsite belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\nSecure .gov websites use HTTPSAlock(LockLocked padlock icon) orhttps://means you've safely connected to the .gov website. Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.\nWe review the central tenets and neuroanatomical basis of the global neuronal workspace (GNW) hypothesis, which attempts to account for the main scientific observations regarding the elementary mechanisms of conscious processing in the human brain. The GNW proposes that, in the conscious state, a non-linear network ignition associated with recurrent processing amplifies and sustains a neural representation, allowing the corresponding information to be globally accessed by local processors. We examine the GNW hypothesis in light of recent data that contrast brain activity evoked by either conscious or nonconscious contents, as well as during conscious or non-conscious states, particularly general anesthesia. We also discuss the relationship between the intertwined concepts of conscious processing, attention, and working memory.\nThe nature and mechanism of conscious processing is arguably one of the most intriguing questions in 21st-century neuroscience. The past two decades have witnessed substantial progress in the field, which has been driven by an array of conceptual and experimental advances (Dehaene and Changeux, 2011;Koch et al., 2016). Just over 20 years ago, two of the authors (J.-P.C. and S.D.) proposed a simple and neurobiologically informed theoretical framework for conscious processing, termed the \u201cglobal neuronal workspace (GNW) hypothesis\u201d (Dehaene et al., 1998). In the present review, we describe its central tenets, neuroanatomic basis, and recent studies supporting or challenging its explanatory power in answering questions of key relevance to conscious access.\nThe RPT of consciousness (Lamme, 2006,2010) also shares with the GNW the postulate that, given a hierarchically ordered neurocognitive architecture, feedforward processing is not sufficient for conscious processing, whereas feedback from higher-order to lower-order areas is critical. The key difference, however, is the extent to which these recurrent networks are thought to be involved. In RPT, which has focused primarily on the visual modality, re-entrant or feedback processes within sensory processing pathways are considered sufficient for phenomenal experience. By contrast, the GNW proposes that conscious access requires a more extensive architecture of reverberant loops, including frontal-parietal regions that enable access of a given representation to a wider array of modular processors.\nHigher-order theories (HOTs) (Lau and Rosenthal, 2011) are similar to the GNW in that they generally posit a central role for the prefrontal cortex in consciousness (Brown et al., 2019). However, the role of the prefrontal cortex in these two classes of theory is markedly different. For HOTs, the role of the prefrontal cortex is to generate a second-order, metacognitive representation of a first-order state (e.g., one generated by primary sensory cortex). Since, for higher-order theory, the meta-representation is the mechanism by which a first-order representation becomes conscious, the prefrontal cortex is the ultimate source of consciousness. Thus, although the two theories both ascribe importance to the prefrontal cortex as astructure, the key differences lie in what is proposed as thefunction. Furthermore, global broadcasting is an important function associated with consciousness according to the GNW theory. By contrast, there is no clear function assigned to consciousness according to HOT.\nGiven the relatively coarse-grained tools of both basic and clinical neuroscience, it is difficult to adjudicate experimentally among these four related theories. For example, the effects of general anesthetics in suppressing recurrent processing (both locally and globally) are broadly consistent with all four theories. Similarly, surrogate measures, such as the perturbational complexity index that have shown promise (Casali et al., 2013), might have originated in one theory (in this case, IIT), but, as noted earlier, the results are consistent with other theories, e.g., the GNW, which also proposes that conscious processing critically depends on the integration of differentiated processors across a network. Indeed, approximations of \u03a6 show an inverse correlation with global modularity during depressed levels of consciousness (Kim et al., 2018), which is also consistent with the GNW hypothesis. Causal interventions in animal models and experimental protocols designed to test multiple theories using the same dataset will be critical in empirically differentiating theories that possess shared features.\nThe GNW hypothesis\u2014even in its simple and limited original formulation\u2014has thus far received substantial experimental support. Yet, there are several issues that remain to be understood and new future directions that remain to be explored. Here, we discuss two open issues: the development of conscious processing and the mechanisms of self-consciousness.\nHow the long-distance networks forming the GNW develop and when they first become functional to generate consciousness are crucial areas for further research. All of the properties of conscious processing that were detailed above do not appear all at once but emerge progressively during fetal and postnatal life, which is why it appears useful to distinguish a few nested levels with the development of the human brain, behavior, and consciousness (Barresi and Moore, 1996;Casey et al., 2005;Changeux, 2006;Dehaene-Lambertz and Spelke, 2015;Dehaene and Changeux, 2011;Filippetti et al., 2015;Gogtay et al., 2004;Gopnik et al., 2001;Lagercrantz and Changeux, 2009;Zelazo, 2004).\n25- to 30-week preterm babies can already process tactile and painful stimuli in the sensory cortex (Bartocci et al., 2006), discriminate sounds (Mahmoudzadeh et al., 2013), and perceive pain (Bembich et al., 2016). The data are insufficient to determine whether those processes correspond to the type of sensory processing that is known to be preserved in coma patients or whether a lowest level of minimal consciousness, as characterized in adult disorders of consciousness (Chennu et al., 2017), may already exist in preterm infants (Lagercrantz et al., 2010).\nAt birth, all major long-distance fiber tracts are already in place (Dubois et al., 2016), although still immature in terms of both their terminal connectivity and their myelination. Within the first year of life, all GNW areas quickly become active, including the prefrontal cortex, although their lack of myelination renders them very slow to process information (Dehaene-Lambertz and Spelke, 2015). An electrophysiological signature of conscious processing\u2014homologous to ignition in adults\u2014was recorded in 5-, 12-, and 15-month-old human babies using a masked-faces paradigm. In all age groups, event-related potentials revealed a late non-linear slow wave that shifted from a weak and delayed response in 5-month-olds (starting around 900 ms) to a more sustained and faster response in older infants (around 750 ms as compared to \u223c300 ms in adults) (Kouider et al., 2013). It is quite possible, but currently untested, that a similar ignition, delayed but present, would be found at birth. These results therefore reveal that the elementary mechanisms underlying ignition are already present in infancy\u2014although they undoubtedly undergo a maturation and an acceleration during development, in addition to the development of more elaborate higher-order processes.\nImportantly, the baby brain is not a miniature adult brain; regional changes of brain connectivity and differential myelination take place that are asynchronous and protracted (Dehaene-Lambertz and Spelke, 2015;Dubois et al., 2016). Primary sensorimotor areas develop earlier than adjacent unimodal associative cortices, whereas higher-order associative regions and their long-range connectivity further develop later and slowly over decades (Dubois et al., 2014;Lebenberg et al., 2019). In other words, the brain connectome becomes progressively integrated within a con\nSource 4:\n# 4 Comparison with Other Theories of Consciousness\n\nThere are many theories of consciousness (of which I focus on the materialist variety): some such as Neurobiological Naturalism (NN) posit ancient evolutionary origins [44]; others, such as Global Workspace Theories (GWT) [5, 32], focus on biological processes; some, such as Integrated Information Theory (IIT) [139], Orch-OR [67], and Panpsychism [58], favor physical explanations and mechanisms; yet others, such as Higher Order Thought (HOT) [17, 55, 122] and Attention Schema Theory (AST) [60] hypothesize architectural \"dual-process\" structures in the brain [42,48,81]. Graziano et al. [63] compare and reconcile several of these theories with AST, and the comparisons remain largely valid with SIFT substituted for AST. However, none of these other theories claim to explain what consciousness\u2014and phenomenal consciousness in particular\u2014does, nor what it is for.\n\nSIFT is different in that it focuses on specific purposes to be accomplished, and develops mechanisms to achieve these, starting with shared intentionality (to achieve teamwork) and proceeding to rationality, which is seen as a fortuitous side-effect, built on shared intentionality: \"teamwork for one\".30 Intentional consciousness is then identified with awareness of attention to, and control of, the mechanisms of shared intentionality and its Upper State and models. Phenomenal consciousness arises because we need to communicate aspects of our sense experience and subconscious Lower State: hence these must be abstracted into the Upper State of shared intentionality, of which we are conscious.\n\nMy presentation of proposed mechanisms provides context for several of the theories identified above; in particular, it delivers a \"dual process\" architecture that is consistent with, and explains some aspects of, existing dual-process models of brain function [42, 48, 81]. Dual-process models hypothesize a logical, not physical, organization of the brain, and it is quite possible that they are realized by physical and neuronal mechanisms with quite a different structure. Plausible candidates include global workspace theory [5] and global neuronal workspace [32].\n\nThe Upper System in my dual-process model, performs calculations whose inputs and outputs are subconscious mental states located in the Lower System: it is a part of the brain that senses and writes to other parts of the brain. While the subconscious Lower System builds representations and models of the external world, the Upper System builds representations of those representations; these constitute\n\n<sup>30</sup>For example, at some time, we have surely all said \"I cannot explain it, but I can show you how to do it.\" Elsewhere, we suggest how a task description can be inferred from demonstrations by inverse reinforcement learning [78]; thus, Alice can construct an abstract model of some task that her Lower System \"knows\" how to do by mentally demonstrating it to herself.\n\nwhat computer scientists call a \"reflective system\" [147] and what philosophers refer to as \"Higher-Order Thought\": that is, thoughts about thoughts [55, 123].31\n\nDual-process and HOT theories generally hypothesize some process whereby activity in the subconscious results in awareness at an upper or higher-order level but do not describe what purpose this serves. Unlike most of these theories, SIFT explains what the upper system does (and hence why it might have evolved). Furthermore, as Graziano observes [60], higher-order awareness must also affect the subconscious lower-level activity (otherwise it is impotent), and few theories address this. In SIFT, these two directions respectively correspond to abstraction and concretion of explanations that are mechanized by the well-accepted operations of predictive processing, and both are involved and coupled in the construction of upper level models and explanations, and lower level behavior.32\n\nGraziano's AST [60] and some HOT theories [17] are the ones closest to SIFT: in our terminology, Graziano proposes that the brain constructs a model (he calls it a schema) of the targets of attention and it is \"aware\" of this model and that awareness constitutes intentional consciousness.33 SIFT proposes that our Upper System builds models of the Lower System and these support the construction of explanations; intentional consciousness then corresponds to awareness of the singlethreaded process of attention and control that manages and applies the resources of the Upper System to these tasks. Graziano has to postulate the attention schema because he does not otherwise have an upper-level system that can provide a location for consciousness, whereas SIFT has its Upper System, so that consciousness can reside directly with its processes of attention and control.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [5] Bernard J.

GWT has been influential in modeling consciousness and higher-order cognition as emerging from competition and integrated flows of information across widespread, parallel neural processes.\nGWT analogizes the mind to a theater, with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage. The brain contains many specialized processes or modules that operate in parallel, much of which is unconscious. Attention acts as a spotlight, bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace. The global workspace is a functional hub of broadcast and integration that allows information to be disseminated across modules. As such it can be classified as afunctionalisttheory of consciousness.[2]\nWhen sensory input, memories, or internal representations receive attention, they enter the global workspace and become accessible to various cognitive processes. As elements compete for attention, those that succeed gain entry to the global workspace, allowing their information to be distributed and coordinated throughout the whole cognitive system.\nGWT resembles the concept of working memory and is proposed to correspond to a 'momentarily active, subjectively experienced' event in working memory. It facilitates top-down control of attention, working memory, planning, and problem-solving through this information sharing.\nIn the 'theater of consciousness', a 'spotlight of selective attention' shines a bright spot on stage, revealing the contents of consciousness. Behind the scenes, in the dark, are the director (executive processes), stagehands, scriptwriters, scene designers, and the like. They shape the visible activities in the bright spot but are themselves invisible.\nWhile aspects of GWT are matters of debate, it remains a focus of current research, including brain interpretations and computational simulations. It serves as a central information exchange, rather than a locus of cognition itself, enabling different specialized brain networks to interact and supporting integrated and adaptive responses.\nBernard Baars derived inspiration for the theory as the cognitive analog of theblackboard systemof early artificial intelligence system architectures, where independent programs shared information.[3]\nGlobal Workspace Theory is one of the leading theories of consciousness.[4][5][6][7]\nBaars (1997) suggests that the global workspace \"is closely related to conscious experience, though not identical to it.\" Conscious events may involve more necessary conditions, such as interacting with a \"self\" system, and an executive interpreter in the brain, such as has been suggested by a number of authors includingMichael S. Gazzaniga.\nNevertheless, GWT can successfully model a number of characteristics of consciousness, such as its role in handling novel situations, its limited capacity, its sequential nature, and its ability to trigger a vast range of unconscious brain processes. Moreover, GWT lends itself well to computational modeling.Stan Franklin'sIDAmodel is one such computational implementation of GWT. See also Dehaene et al. (2003), Shanahan (2006) and Bao (2020).\nGWT also specifies \"behind the scenes\" contextual systems, which shape conscious contents without ever becoming conscious, such as thedorsalcorticalstream of the visual system. This architectural approach leads to specific neural hypotheses.Sensoryevents in different modalities may compete with each other forconsciousnessif their contents are incompatible. For example, the audio and video track of a movie will compete rather than fuse if the two tracks are out of sync by more than 100 ms., approximately. The 100 ms time domain corresponds closely with the known brain physiology of consciousness, including brain rhythms in the alpha-theta-gamma domain, and event-related potentials in the 200\u2013300 ms domain.[10]\nHowever, much of this research is based on studies of unconscious priming and recent studies show that many of the methods used for unconscious priming are flawed.[11]\nStanislas Dehaeneextended the global workspace with the \"neuronal avalanche\" showing how sensory information gets selected to be broadcast throughout the cortex.[12]Many brain regions, the prefrontal cortex, anterior temporal lobe, inferior parietal lobe, and the precuneus all send and receive numerous projections to and from a broad variety of distant brain regions, allowing the neurons there to integrate information over space and time. Multiple sensory modules can therefore converge onto a single coherent interpretation, for example, a \"red sports car zooming by\". This global interpretation is broadcast back to the global workspace creating the conditions for the emergence of a single state of consciousness, at once differentiated and integrated.\nAlternatively, the theory ofpractopoiesissuggests that the global workspace is achieved in the brain primarily through fast adaptive mechanisms of nerve cells.[13]According to that theory, connectivity does not matter much. Critical is rather the fact that neurons can rapidly adapt to the sensory context within which they operate. Notably, for achieving a global workspace, the theory presumes that these fast adaptive mechanisms have the capability to learn when and how to adapt.\nJ. W. Dalton has criticized the global workspace theory on the grounds that it provides, at best, an account of the cognitivefunctionof consciousness, and fails even to address the deeper problem of its nature, of what consciousnessis, and of how any mental process whatsoever can be conscious: thehard problem of consciousness.[14]A. C. Elitzur has argued, however, \"While this hypothesis does not address the 'hard problem', namely, the very nature of consciousness, it constrains any theory that attempts to do so and provides important insights into the relation between consciousness and cognition.\", as much as any consciousness theory is constrained by the natural brain perception limitations.[15]\nNew work by Richard Robinson shows promise in establishing the brain functions involved in this model and may help shed light on how we understand signs or symbols and reference these to our semiotic registers.[16]\nSource 6:\n# Consciousness Driven Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity\n\nSushant Yadav\u2217 , Santosh Chaudhary\u2217 , Rajesh Kumar\u2020 , \u2217 Department of Mathematics, MNIT Jaipur, Jaipur, India, 302017 \u2020Department of Electrical Engineering, MNIT Jaipur, Jaipur, India, 302017\n\n*Abstract*\u2014Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, employ sparse and asynchronous spikes for communication.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe fundamental distinction between machines and minds lies in their core functions as machine computes, while mind comprehend and possess consciousness [1]. Machines process data through algorithms and calculations, functioning within predefined parameters, whereas minds possess the capacity to understand concepts beyond mere computation. Moreover, minds exhibit consciousness, a complex state of awareness and subjective experience that transcends the capabilities of machines [2]. Thus, while machines excel in processing information, it is the inherent understanding and consciousness of minds that truly differentiate them. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) which is considered as modern machine tries to mimic mind [3]. The core part of AI is considered as artificial neural network (ANN) [4]. ANN are mathematical models of biological neural networks. However, the core computational models of ANN have inherent limitation of energy consumption [5]. To address this issue, SNNs have emerged as an alternative model. SNNs depart from traditional ANNs by mimicking the brain's spiking neuron behavior, using discrete, event-driven communication via spikes, similar to biological systems. The crucial capability of SNN is defined by its learning mechanism i.e. STDP [6].\n\nSTDP is a well-established concept in SNNs for learning, which suggests that the timing of neuronal firing plays a crucial role in modifying the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. But it still misses a crucial part of mind i.e. Consciousness. Consciousness, is a multifaceted phenomenon that encompasses subjective awareness, self-reflection, and the integration of information in brain. There are various theories and models of consciousness present in literature. As in [7] presents review of Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) in which Neuroscientists aim to identify the neural processes and brain regions associated with conscious experience. Studies using neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and EEG (Electroencephalography) seek to pinpoint the neural correlates of specific conscious states, such as perception, attention, and self-awareness. In [8] Global Workspace Theory: Proposed by cognitive scientist Bernard Baars, suggests that consciousness arises from the dynamic interactions of distributed neural networks. According to this theory, information becomes conscious when it enters a global workspace where it can be accessed by multiple cognitive systems, facilitating flexible behavior and higher cognitive functions. In article [9] gives an overview about Higher-order Theories of Consciousness. These theories propose that consciousness depends on the brain's ability to represent mental states as objects of awareness. According to higher-order theories, consciousness emerges when the brain generates higher-order representations of its own cognitive processes, allowing for introspection and self-awareness. In [10] Integrated Information Theory (IIT) developed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi, proposes that consciousness arises from the integration of information within the brain. According to IIT, a conscious experience corresponds to a specific pattern of information that is both highly integrated and irreducible. This theory provides a mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness and has led to new insights into its neural basis. There are even more theories and ideas to view consciousness like altered states of consciousness [11], philosophical perspectives on consciousness [12], clinical studies on consciousness [13] etc.. However among all these IIT is considered the most popular as account of the integration of information may be understood as a response to this problem [14].\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] S.

This acceptance is based on a wealth of evidence from experimental studies, brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and EEG, and theoretical frameworks like integrated information theory (IIT) within neuroscience and the philosophy of mind. This paper explores the potential for artificial consciousness by merging neuromorphic design and architecture with brain simulations. It proposes the Neuromorphic Correlates of Artificial Consciousness (NCAC) as a theoretical framework. While the debate on artificial consciousness remains contentious due to our incomplete grasp of consciousness, this work may raise eyebrows and invite criticism. Nevertheless, this optimistic and forward-thinking approach is fueled by insights from the Human Brain Project, advancements in brain imaging like EEG and fMRI, and recent strides in AI and computing, including quantum and neuromorphic designs. Additionally, this paper outlines how machine learning can play a role in crafting artificial consciousness, aiming to realise machine consciousness and awareness in the future.\n\n*K*eywords Neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), Integrated information theory (IIT), Artificial consciousness\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nConsciousness, originating from the Latin conscius (con- \"together\" and scio \"to know\"), pertains to the awareness of both internal and external existence [1]. The modern concept of consciousness is attributed to John Locke, who defined it as \"the perception of what passes in a man's own mind\" [2]. The most challenging aspect of understanding consciousness is often referred to as the 'hard problem' of qualia. This encompasses the subjective experiences associated with phenomena like the specific quality of redness or the feeling of pain [3]. At its core, consciousness is the state or quality of being aware of and able to perceive one's surroundings, thoughts, emotions, and experiences. It is also described as the subjective experience of \"feeling like something.\" Historically, it has been a topic of discussion for philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists, but the realm of artificial intelligence has brought it into a new spotlight in search of the notion of artificial consciousness. Given our limited or non-uniform understanding of consciousness, a fundamental question is whether machines could achieve artificial consciousness.\n\nThe philosophy of consciousness has a deep-rooted history, originating from the concept of an immortal soul in Greek philosophy [4] and Avicenna's synthesis of 'nafs' and rational enquiry, 'aqal' [5]. These early ideas set the stage for Descartes' influential mind-body dualism [6], which became a cornerstone for further philosophical enquiries. Modern perspectives, such as Immanuel Kant's transcendental idealism [7] and the phenomenological approach advocated by thinkers like Husserl and Heidegger [8], delve into the active role of consciousness in shaping our perception and understanding of reality. Collectively, these perspectives weave a multifaceted narrative, enriching our exploration of consciousness's nature and its profound impact on human existence and philosophical enquiry.\n\nBuilding upon the rich philosophical foundations, the pursuit of understanding consciousness has been further enriched by groundbreaking developments in neuroscience, particularly the exploration of neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) [9]. The advent of advanced brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), has allowed scientists to peer into the neural correlates of conscious experience.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg</img>\nFigure 1: Schema of the neural processes underlying consciousness, from Christof Koch's research, illustrating the intricate interplay of neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) and their dynamic interactions within the brain's complex network. Koch's work sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms that give rise to conscious experience, offering valuable insights into the nature of cognition and subjective awareness. Image source: [9]\n</F>\n\nPioneering theories like the global workspace theory, proposed by Bernard Baars [10], and the integrated information theory, developed by Giulio Tononi [11], have sought to map the neurobiological underpinnings of conscious awareness. Moreover, the discovery of specific brain regions and networks, such as the default mode network [12] and other supporting networks [13], has shed light on the intricate interplay between conscious and unconscious processes.\n\nThe study of consciousness has entered a new phase with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the quest for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This development has sparked a compelling debate about whether machines can exhibit a form of artificial consciousness comparable to human cognition. As researchers delve deeper into creating intelligent systems that mimic human-like reasoning and understanding, exploring the potential for artificial consciousness has become a captivating frontier in scientific enquiry, igniting discussions and reflections within the scientific community.\n\nThe thought experiments of the \"philosophical zombie\" and \"fading qualia\" are neutral in their stance regarding the prospect of artificial consciousness [3]. Instead, they serve as tools for exploring the nature of consciousness itself, regardless of whether it arises in biological or artificial systems. The philosophical zombie scenario questions whether a being that behaves identically to a conscious being but lacks subjective experience can truly be considered conscious. This highlights the intrinsic difficulty in defining and quantifying subjective awareness, a core aspect of the hard problem. Similarly, fading qualia scenarios explore the gradual reduction or alteration of subjective experiences while maintaining normal external behaviours. These experiments raise fundamental questions about subjective experience, awareness, and the relationship between consciousness and physical processes, challenging our understanding of what it means to be conscious. In the context of artificial consciousness, these experiments highlight the complexity and depth of the challenges involved without explicitly advocating for or against the possibility of achieving genuine artificial consciousness.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Clive Staples Lewis. *Studies in words*.

Sometimes the models are labeled theories of consciousness. Anil Seth defines such models as those that relate brain phenomena such as fast irregular electrical activity and widespread brain activation to properties of consciousness such as qualia. Seth allows for different types of models including mathematical, logical, verbal and conceptual models.\n\nNeural correlates of consciousness \n\nThe Neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) formalism is used as a major step towards explaining consciousness. The NCC are defined to constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious percept, and consequently sufficient for consciousness. In this formalism, consciousness is viewed as a state-dependent property of some undefined complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.\n\nEight-circuit model of consciousness \n\nTimothy Leary introduced and Robert Anton Wilson and Antero Alli elaborated  the Eight-circuit model of consciousness as hypothesis that \"suggested eight periods [circuits] and twenty-four stages of neurological evolution\".\n\nMultiple drafts model \n\nDaniel Dennett proposed a physicalist, information processing based multiple drafts model of consciousness described more fully in his 1991 book, Consciousness Explained.\n\nDehaene\u2013Changeux model \n\nThe Dehaene\u2013Changeux model (DCM), also known as the global neuronal workspace or the global cognitive workspace model is a computer model of the neural correlates of consciousness  programmed as a neural network.  Stanislas Dehaene and Jean-Pierre Changeux introduced this model in 1986. It is associated with Bernard Baars's Global workspace theory for consciousness.\n\nClouding of consciousness \n\nClouding of consciousness, also known as brain fog or mental fog, is a term used in medicine denoting an abnormality in the regulation of the overall level of consciousness that is mild and less severe than a delirium. It is part of an overall model where there's regulation of the \"overall level\" of the consciousness of the brain and aspects responsible for \"arousal\" or \"wakefulness\" and awareness of oneself and of the environment.\n\nElectromagnetic theories of consciousness \n\n \nElectromagnetic theories of consciousness propose that consciousness can be understood as an electromagnetic phenomenon that occurs when a brain produces an electromagnetic field with specific characteristics.  Some electromagnetic theories are also quantum mind theories of consciousness; examples include quantum brain dynamics (QBD).\n\nOrchestrated objective reduction \n\n \nOrchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR) model is based on the hypothesis that consciousness in the brain originates from quantum processes inside neurons, rather than from connections between neurons (the conventional view). The mechanism is held to be associated with molecular structures called microtubules. The hypothesis was advanced by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff and has been the subject of extensive debate,\n\nThalamic reticular networking model of consciousness \n\nMin proposed in a 2010 paper a Thalamic reticular networking model of consciousness. The model suggests consciousness as a \"mental state embodied through TRN-modulated synchronization of thalamocortical networks\". In this model the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is suggested as ideally suited for controlling the entire cerebral network, and responsible (via GABAergic networking) for synchronization of neural activity.\n\nFunctionalism (philosophy of mind) \n\nFunctionalism is a view in the theory of the mind. It states that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role \u2013 that is, they have causal relations to other mental states, numerous sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.\n\nSociology of human consciousness \n\nSociology of human consciousness uses the theories and methodology of sociology to explain human consciousness. The theory and its models emphasize the importance of language, collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-reflectivity. It argues that the shape and feel of human consciousness is heavily social.\n\nReferences  \n\nConsciousness\nConsciousness studies\nBrain\nCognition\nCognitive architecture\nCognitive modeling\nCognitive neuroscience\nCognitive science\nCognitive science lists\nMental processes\nNeuroscience\nNeuropsychology\nSource 9:\nProblems are raised with the global workspace hypothesis of consciousness, for example about exactly how global the workspace needs to be for consciousness to suddenly be present. Problems are also raised withCarruthers\u2019s (2019)version that excludes conceptual (categorical or discrete) representations, and in which phenomenal consciousness can be reduced to physical processes, with instead a different levels of explanation approach to the relation between the brain and the mind advocated. A different theory of phenomenal consciousness is described, in which there is a particular computational system involved in which Higher Order Syntactic Thoughts are used to perform credit assignment on first order thoughts of multiple step plans to correct them by manipulating symbols in a syntactic type of working memory. This provides a good evolutionary reason for the evolution of this kind of computational module, with which, it is proposed, phenomenal consciousness is associated. Some advantages of this HOST approach to phenomenal consciousness are then described with reference not only to the global workspace approach, but also to Higher Order Thought (HOT) theories. It is hypothesized that the HOST system which requires the ability to manipulate first order symbols in working memory might utilize parts of the prefrontal cortex implicated in working memory, and especially the left inferior frontal gyrus, which is involved in language and probably syntactical processing. Overall, the approach advocated is to identify the computations that are linked to consciousness, and to analyze the neural bases of those computations.\nA theory of phenomenal consciousness has recently been described that holds that this arises when there is a global workspace with non-conceptual content (Carruthers, 2019). Non-conceptual content refers to content that is about continuous representations, for example about exactly how large an apple is, or just how red it is. The theory holds that phenomenal consciousness can be reduced to a natural (physical or physically realized) property. Further, it is held that phenomenal consciousness can be associated with first order thoughts, and does not require higher order thoughts (HOTs) (thoughts about thoughts, including reflection).Carruthers (2019)can identify no useful function performed by phenomenal consciousness, and does not take a computational approach.\nAs a computational neuroscientist (Rolls, 2016), I find that it is helpful in understanding brain and cognitive function to identify the computations being performed by particular brain areas to perform their functions. I therefore take here the computational neuroscience approach, to identify what may be weaknesses in and alternatives to the hypotheses described above (Carruthers, 2019), and then describe and develop further, a different, higher order syntactic thought (HOST), theory of phenomenal consciousness (Rolls, 2016). Phenomenal consciousness refers to subjective feelings, about what it feels like to have a perception, or an emotion, etc.\nThe first part of this paper includes a neuroscience assessment of some of the key issues in the area of neuroscience around which Carruthers builds his theory. It shows why I think that alternatives to his approach, and to global workspace theories in general (Dehaene, 2014), should be sought. This includes a new consideration of levels of explanation in neuroscience, and how causality may be assessed in relation to brain vs. mental representations. An implication is that phenomena at one level, such as phenomenal consciousness, cannot be reduced to what co-occurs at a lower level, such as physical processes. The second part of this paper outlines and develops further a higher order syntactic thought (HOST) theory of consciousness, which specifically identifies a kind of computation performed by the brain that the theory holds is present when phenomenal consciousness is reported. That goes beyond global workspace theory, which specifies a lot of processing, but not the kind that is important for consciousness. My HOST theory also identifies important functions performed by those computations which go beyond what is described in HOT approaches to consciousness.\nShea and Frith (2019), like me, believe that global workspace theories are inadequate, and that some type of metacognition may be involved. In my Host theory [see section \u201cA Higher Order Syntactic Thought (HOST) Theory of Phenomenal Consciousness\u201d], I propose a particular type of metacognition that is involved in phenomenal consciousness, and what the advantages are of that type of metacognition.\nFor these reasons, I hold that current global workspace theories are inadequate theories of phenomenal consciousness (Rolls, 2011,2012b,2016), though they do help to make progress with understanding at least access consciousness.\nCarruthers (2019)also considers what we learn about consciousness from attentional phenomena. Apparently contrary to global workspace hypotheses is research on attention and phenomenal consciousness. For example, inattentional blindness indicates that we only have phenomenal consciousness for visual stimuli to which we are selectively paying attention (Mack and Rock, 1998;Simons and Rensink, 2005), which is when the workspace is not global, but focused by attention. For example, if we pay attention to a baseball game, and are told to watch the ball, we are not aware of a gorilla wandering boldly across the scene (Simons and Chabris, 1999). This can be accounted for by the well-understood mechanisms of attention. In a complex spatial scene, the receptive fields of inferior temporal cortex neurons decrease from approximately 70 degrees in diameter to a few degrees, about the size of a typical object (Rolls et al., 2003;Aggelopoulos and Rolls, 2005). This can be accounted for by local lateral inhibition decreasing the size of inferior temporal cortex Gaussian receptive field profile neurons (Trappenberg et al., 2002). That would mean that if fixating the ball in the ball game, the inferior temporal cortex neurons would not respond to the gorilla, who was not being fixated and was several degrees from the fovea.\nTop down attention can again influence what enters phenomenal consciousness, but this is not surprising, for top\u2013down attentional mechanisms facilitate the representations of objects to which we are paying attention by a top\u2013down bias, relative to other objects (Rolls and Deco, 2002;Deco and Rolls, 2004,2005a,2005b;Rolls, 2016).\nWe can now understand brain processing from the level of ion channels in neurons, through neuronal biophysics, to neuronal firing, through the computations performed by populations of neurons, and how their activity is reflected by functional neuroimaging, to behavioral and cognitive effects (Rolls, 2016). Activity at any one level can be used to understand activity at the next. This raises the philosophical issue of how we should consider causality with these different levels (Rolls, 2016). Does the brain cause effects in the mind, or do events at the mental, mind, level influence brain activity?\nWhat is the relation between the mind and the brain? This is the mind-brain or mind-body problem. Do mental, mind, events cause brain events? Do brain events cause mental effects? What can we learn from the relation between software and hardware in a computer about mind-brain interactions and how causality operates? Neuroscience shows that there is a close relation between mind and matter (captured by the following inverted saying: \u2018Never matter, no mind\u2019).\nCarruthers (2019)holds that phenomenal consciousness can be reduced to a natural (physical or physically realized) property. This, for him, takes much of the mystery out of phenomenal consciousness, for it is just a matter of matter, and simplifies his approach to all the questions raised by phenomenal consciousness. But is it reasonable to argue that one can reduce what is at a very high level in the processing system to the physical properties that implement the processing at a lower level? I do not think so. To make this point, we need to consider how different levels of the system, such as the neuronal level and the computational function being performed, relate to each other. This is part of the very big problem of the relation between the mind and the brain. Here is my approach to this.\nOne possible view that has been described (Rolls, 2016) is that the relationship between m\nSource 10:\nMetastability in computational neuroscience refers to the brain's ability to integrate various functional parts and produce coordinated neural oscillations, essential for conscious activity. This concept describes how the brain processes random environmental cues into predictable patterns through a state of prolonged disequilibrium. EEG measurements reveal oscillatory patterns correlating with specific frequencies, indicating parallel processing in cortical domains. Metastability occurs in the 1/f regime, where noise is converted into identifiable waveforms, enabling conscious responses. Theories like the Haken-Kelso-Bunz model and the dynamic core hypothesis explore neural network coordination and the integration center of consciousness. The global workspace hypothesis emphasizes re-entrant connectivity and long-range signal flow. The operational architectonics theory interprets metastability as the coexistence of autonomous and coordinated brain functions. Future research will likely investigate metastability's role in neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries.\n\nThe chunk is: A developing field in coordination dynamics involves the theory of social coordination, which attempts to relate the DC to normal human development of complex social cues following certain patterns of interaction.  This work is aimed at understanding how human social interaction is mediated by metastability of neural networks.  fMRI and EEG are particularly useful in mapping thalamocortical response to social cues in experimental studies.\n\nA new theory called the phi complex has been developed by J. A. Scott Kelso and fellow researchers at  Florida Atlantic University to provide experimental results for the theory of social coordination dynamics.  In Kelso's experiments, two subjects were separated by an opaque barrier and asked to wag their fingers; then the barrier was removed and the subjects were instructed to continue to wag their fingers as if no change had occurred.  After a short period, the movements of the two subjects sometimes became coordinated and synchronized (but other times continued to be asynchronous).  The link between EEG and conscious social interaction is described as Phi, one of several brain rhythms operating in the 10\u00a0Hz range.  Phi consists of two components: one to favor solitary behavior and another to favor interactive (interpersonal) behavior.  Further analysis of Phi may reveal the social and interpersonal implications of degenerative diseases such as schizophrenia\u2014or may provide insight into common social relationships such as the dynamics of alpha and omega-males or the popular bystander effect describing how people diffuse personal responsibility in emergency situations depending on the number of other individuals present.\n\nDynamic core\n\nA second theory of metastability involves a so-called dynamic core, which is a term to loosely describe the thalamocortical region believed to be the integration center of consciousness. The dynamic core hypothesis (DCH) reflects the use and disuse of interconnected neuronal networks during stimulation of this region.  A computer model of 65,000 spiking neurons shows that neuronal groups existing in the cortex and thalamus interact in the form of synchronous oscillation.  The interaction between distinct neuronal groups forms the dynamic core and may help explain the nature of conscious experience. A critical feature of the DCH is that instead of thinking binarily about transitions between neural integration and non-integration (i.e., that the two are either one or the other with no in-between), the metastable nature of the dynamic core can allow for a continuum of integration.\n\nNeural Darwinism\n\nOne theory used to integrate the dynamic core with conscious thought involves a developing concept known as neural Darwinism.  In this model, metastable interactions in the thalamocortical region cause a process of selectionism through re-entry (a phenomenon describing the overall reciprocity and interactivity between signals in distant parts of the brain through coupled signal latency).  Neuronal selectivity involves mechanochemical events that take place pre- and post-natally whereby neuronal connections are influenced by environmental experiences.  The modification of synaptic signals as it relates to the dynamic core provides further explanation for the DCH.\n\nDespite growing evidence for the DCH, the ability to generate mathematical constructs to model and predict dynamic core behavior has been slow to progress.  Continued development of stochastic processes designed to graph neuronal signals as chaotic and non-linear has provided some algorithmic basis for analyzing how chaotic environmental signals are coupled to enhance selectivity of neural outgrowth or coordination in the dynamic core.\n\nGlobal workspace hypothesis\n\nThe global workspace hypothesis is another theory to elucidate metastability, and has existed in some form since 1983.  This hypothesis also focuses on the phenomenon of re-entry, the ability of a routine or process to be used by multiple parts of the brain simultaneously.  Both the DCH and global neuronal workspace (GNW) models involve re-entrance, but the GNW model elaborates on re-entrant connectivity between distant parts of the brain and long-range signal flow. Workspace neurons are similar anatomically but separated spatially from each other.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the GNW is that with sufficient intensity and length over which a signal travels, a small initiation signal can be compounded to activate an \"ignition\" of a critical spike-inducing state.  This idea is analogous to a skier on the slope of a mountain, who, by disrupting a few blocks of ice with his skis, initiates a giant avalanche in his wake. To help prove the circuit-like amplification theory, research has shown that inducing lesions in long-distance connections corrupts performance in integrative models.\n\nA popular experiment to demonstrate the global workspace hypothesis involves showing a subject a series of backward-masked visual words (e.g., \"the dog sleeps quietly\" is shown as \"ylteiuq speels god eht\") and then asking the subject to identify the forward \"translation\" of these words.  Not only did fMRI detect activity in the word-recognition portion of the cortex, but additionally, activity is often detected in the parietal and prefrontal cortices.  In almost every experiment, conscious input in word and audition tasks shows a much wider use of integrated portions of the brain than in identical unconscious input.  The wide distribution and constant signal transfer between different areas of the brain in experimental results is a common method to attempt to prove the neural workspace hypothesis.  More studies are being conducted to determine precisely the correlation between conscious and unconscious task deliberation in the realm of the global workspace.\n\nThe operational architectonics theory of brain\u2013mind\n\nAlthough the concept of metastability has been around in Neuroscience for some time, the specific interpretation of metastability in the context of brain operations of different complexity has been developed by Andrew and Alexander Fingelkurts within their model of Operational Architectonics of brain\u2013mind functioning. Metastability is basically a theory of how global integrative and local segregative tendencies coexist in the brain. The Operational Architectonics is centered on the fact that in the metastable regime of brain functioning, the individual parts of the brain exhibit tendencies to function autonomously at the same time as they exhibit tendencies for coordinated activity. In accordance with Operational Architectonics, the synchronized operations produced by distributed neuronal assemblies constitute the metastable spatial-temporal patterns. They are metastable because intrinsic differences in the activity between neuronal assemblies are sufficiently large that they each do their own job (operation), while still retaining a tendency to be coordinated together in order to realize the complex brain operation.\n\nThe future of metastability\n\nIn addition to study investigating the effects of metastable interactions on traditional social function, much research will likely focus on determining the role of the coordinated dynamic system and the global workspace in the progression of debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and schizophrenia.  Undoubtedly, spatiotemporal imaging techniques such as MEG and fMRI will elaborate on results already gleaned from analysis of EEG output.\n\nAn interest in the effect of a traumatic or semi-traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the coordinated dynamical system has developed in the last five years as the number of TBI cases has risen from war-related injuries.\n\nSee also\nCognitive psychology\nElectroencephalogram\n\nReferences\n\nComputational neuroscience"

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to design a multi-layered organoid system that accurately models the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for drug testing. Hmm, where do I even start? Let me break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that the BBB is really important because it regulates a lot of substances in the body, including drugs. But I'm not entirely sure how it works exactly. From what I remember, the BBB keeps certain chemicals out of our bodies. These include things like neurotransmitters, hormones, and antibiotics. So for drug testing, they want to ensure that only safe or specific medications are administered without messing with the brain.\n\nNow, creating a model for this would probably involve several layers, each representing different parts of the system. I've heard about using materials like polyethylene and polymers in layered structures before. Maybe these can mimic the structure of biological cells? Oh, right, there's something called a polyelectrolyte membrane that could form between two layers. That makes sense because it would allow drugs to pass through easily if they're on one side but block them on the other.\n\nI'm thinking about how many layers I need in total. Maybe 3 or 4? Each layer representing a different part of the BBB, like receptor sites and transport proteins. If each layer has multiple cells, that could add complexity but make it more accurate. Wait, but if the barriers are too thick, wouldn't they affect drug diffusion?\n\nAlso, I should consider what each layer represents. Perhaps the outermost layer is for entry points, letting certain molecules in without blocking others. Then an intermediate layer with selective channels and receptors, and a core that's completely blocked except for specific drugs. That way, only specific drugs can pass through while others are held back.\n\nOh, I remember something about electroporation being used in drug testing systems. Maybe the innermost layer is made of conductive polymers so it can be easily electroinjected into the body. Then, external layers allow some entry but block others once they're inside. That might work for simulating how drugs would move through the BBB.\n\nWait, but how do I ensure that only specific drugs are allowed to pass? Maybe using different materials with varying permeability levels in each layer. For example, some layers have high permeability except for a few receptors, and others have low or no permeability but specific receptors.\n\nI also need to think about the materials themselves. Polytetrafluoroethylene is used in drug delivery systems because it's flexible and can be electroinjected. Maybe I should use something similar in the barriers. Polyelectrolytes could help form the barriers, keeping drugs out without letting them escape easily.\n\nI wonder if there are any existing research or models that have done this before. Maybe scientists have built systems where drug levels inside vs outside show different concentrations to test for efficacy. That would be a good way to validate the model in real life.\n\nAlso, considering the multi-layered approach, each layer should be biocompatible with tissues and organs to simulate reality accurately. This way, when testing drugs, their effects on different layers (like brain or heart) can be modeled without having an actual human body in front of them.\n\nI'm a bit fuzzy on how exactly the barriers are structured. Maybe the first layer allows some entry but blocks most substances except for those that bind to receptors. The second layer has channels that allow selective drugs through while blocking others. The third layer completely blocks movement, only letting specific drugs enter.\n\nBut wait, what if there's any leaky entry or exit? I guess adding a fourth layer with some porosity could help reduce leaks, making the system more reliable. Or maybe using ion-pumps to keep certain ions in place, preventing them from moving freely through the barriers.\n\nI'm also thinking about the electrical fields used. Polyelectrolytes form channels when an electric field is applied, allowing drugs or ions to pass. So if each layer has different electrical properties, only specific drugs can flow between layers while others are trapped inside their respective barriers.\n\nBut how does that work exactly? If a drug enters through one barrier layer, it needs the correct electrical potential to move. Then when it passes into an intermediate layer, another electric field is applied there, allowing more entry or movement. Finally, it exits into the core, where it's protected.\n\nThis seems complex but maybe feasible with careful engineering and material design. Each layer could be made of different polymers that conduct electricity in specific ways, ensuring only certain ions pass through each barrier without crossing the whole system.\n\nI should also consider the practical aspects of creating this system. How precise do I need to be? Can it be done with current technologies? Maybe some existing materials or compounds have been tested for their electrical conductivity and permeability.\n\nAnother thought: how does the innermost layer behave if it's just a conductor instead of an electroinjected part? It might not allow entry because it's too conductive, but maybe that's intended to hold onto specific drugs until they're injected. The outer layers would then let in or out depending on the electric fields.\n\nI'm also curious about how this model would be used beyond testing. Would it help in designing drug delivery systems that are more controlled and safer? Maybe by simulating how drugs move through different body parts, ensuring effectiveness while minimizing side effects.\n\nBut for now, focusing on accurately modeling the BBB is the main goal. Each layer needs to represent a part of the barrier effectively, with the correct permeability levels and selective interactions at receptors. Maybe using multiple cell types in each layer could add more realism but also increase complexity.\n\nI think I need to outline each layer's function, materials used, how they interact electrically, and any specific properties like conductivity or ion retention. That way, it becomes a comprehensive model for drug testing purposes.\n</think>\n\nTo design a multi-layered organoid system that accurately models the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for drug testing, we can structure the system into three layers: an outermost, intermediate, and core layer. Each layer represents different parts of the BBB:\n\n1. **Outermost Layer**: This serves as entry points allowing certain molecules in without blocking most others. It can be made using flexible polymers that form barriers when an electric field is applied.\n\n2. **Intermediate Layer**: Contains selective channels with receptors, allowing specific drugs to pass while blocking others. Polyelectrolyte membranes can facilitate ion movement between layers and help maintain selective permeability.\n\n3. **Core Layer**: Completely blocked except for specific drugs, acting as a containment zone for targeted medications. This layer ensures that only the intended substances can enter without interference from other molecules.\n\n**Materials and Features:**\n- Use flexible polymers (e.g., polyethylene) for flexibility.\n- Polyelectrolyte membranes facilitate barrier formation.\n- Ionic materials to manage electrical conductivity between layers.\n- Consider porosity in additional layers for leak prevention.\n- Electric fields applied at each layer allow specific movement, with the innermost layer acting as a conductor holding onto drugs via injection.\n\nThis model allows simulating drug diffusion and efficacy testing accurately, providing insights into drug behavior across biological systems."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this article about drug delivery to the brain's blood-brain barrier. It seems pretty technical, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the article mentions that drugs have a hard time getting into the brain because of something called lipophilicity. Lipophilic means they're not very polar, so they don't stick well to the cell membrane. But I remember hearing about drugs being more effective when they are polar. So maybe this study found that it's not just about being polar but also about how the drug is structured.\n\nThey used various factors like Gibbs adsorption isotherm and surface area of the drug. Gibbs is something like how a molecule interacts with a surface, right? And surface area affects diffusion too. The study said that just having a certain surface area isn't enough; it's all about how the structure of the molecule interacts with the surface.\n\nThen they looked at barrier permittivity, which was measured by surface activity. Surface activity is about how much energy a molecule has on its surface. So if a drug can cross the membrane without much effort, that would make it more permeable. But still, it's not enough\u2014it depends on both surface area and interactions with the material.\n\nPro-drugs are another issue. Pro drugs disguise the active part of the drug to look like something less effective or even biologically inactive. This could mean they stick around longer in the brain without being broken down by enzymes. So if there's a lot of pro drug in the brain, it might accumulate and be ineffective.\n\nExosomes are introduced as a solution for delivering drugs directly into neurons after injection. Exosome systems have been used before to deliver small molecules like drugs or even proteins. They can cross the blood-brain barrier, right? But how exactly do they work? I think they release molecules inside the cell where they're processed\u2014like in translation or protein synthesis.\n\nThe European Project OXO is mentioned as a big initiative with funding for academic institutions and biotech companies. If this system is successful, it could revolutionize drug delivery to the brain. But there are still challenges like scalability and ensuring the drug doesn't get degraded by enzymes once inside neurons.\n\nThere's also the problem of measuring exosome activity because proteins in general aren't easily tracked. If you want to test effectiveness, you need a way to know how much drug is entering the central nervous system.\n\nSo putting it all together, the article seems to be talking about several methods to improve drug delivery beyond just lipophilicity. They're considering structural modifications (pro-drugs), exosome systems for direct delivery, and maybe some scaling up of these solutions with larger grants. But there are still hurdles like enzyme degradation inside neurons and measuring how much drug actually gets through.\n\nI'm also thinking about the practical implications. If exosomes can deliver drugs directly to neurons, it could make treatments more effective by bypassing the need for initial systemic administration. But I wonder what happens once in the brain? How does the drug get active there? Do they target specific neurons?\n\nThe article mentions that pro-drugs might take a long time before being released into action because of enzymatic degradation. So maybe it's a two-step process\u2014first getting to the cell, then getting through.\n\nOverall, this seems like an exciting field with potential for big impact in treating diseases related to the brain. But more research is needed on enzyme kinetics inside neurons and exosome efficiency across different tissues.\n</think>\n\nThe article discusses several innovative approaches to improve drug delivery to the brain's blood-brain barrier (BBAR), addressing challenges such as lipophilicity and enzyme degradation. Here's a structured summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Lipophilicity and Structural Considerations**:\n   - Drugs are difficult to enter the brain due to their lack of polar nature, which is contrary to expectations.\n   - Factors like Gibbs adsorption isotherm, surface area, and barrier permittivity are considered. These factors influence permeability but also depend on molecular interactions.\n\n2. **Pro-Drugs**:\n   - Pro-drugs disguise active molecules to prevent enzymatic degradation inside neurons, potentially bypassing the need for systemic initial administration.\n   - This could lead to prolonged drug accumulation in the brain and ineffective release of the active form.\n\n3. **Exosomes as Delivery Systems**:\n   - Exosome systems can deliver drugs directly into neurons after injection, offering a novel approach to bypass traditional systemic methods.\n   - These systems are still under development but show promise for direct delivery of therapeutic molecules.\n\n4. **European Project OXO**:\n   - The European Union's OXO initiative aims to scale up exosome-based drug delivery, with significant funding for academic and biotech companies.\n   - However, challenges remain in measuring exosome activity due to the difficulty of tracking proteins in general.\n\n5. **Enzymic Degradation Issues**:\n   - Pro-drugs may take longer to release because enzymes degrade them once inside neurons, potentially delaying their action.\n   - This suggests a two-step process: initial entry into neurons and then active delivery at specific neuronal targets.\n\n6. **Scalability and Practical Implications**:\n   - The potential for exosome-based systems could revolutionize drug delivery, leading to more effective treatments.\n   - However, scalability across diverse brain tissues is still under exploration with ongoing research on enzyme kinetics inside neurons and exosome efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the article highlights promising avenues in drug delivery, emphasizing the need for further research on enzyme dynamics within neurons and the development of scalable exosome-based systems. These advancements could significantly impact treatments for diseases associated with the brain.",

Med. Technol., 15 February 2021\nThis article is part of the Research TopicTissue Engineering for Drug Discovery and Personalized Medicine: Volume IView all 6 articles\nMedical progress has historically depended on scientific discoveries. Until recently, science was driven by technological advancements that, once translated to the clinic, fostered new treatments and interventions. More recently, technology-driven medical progress has often outpaced laboratory research. For example, intravascular devices, pacemakers for the heart and brain, spinal cord stimulators, and surgical robots are used routinely to treat a variety of diseases. The rapid expansion of science into ever more advanced molecular and genetic mechanisms of disease has often distanced laboratory-based research from day-to-day clinical realities that remain based on evidence and outcomes. A recognized reason for this hiatus is the lack of laboratory tools that recapitulate the clinical reality faced by physicians and surgeons. To overcome this, the NIH and FDA have in the recent past joined forces to support the development of a \u201chuman-on-a-chip\u201d that will allow research scientists to perform experiments on a realistic replica when testing the effectiveness of novel experimental therapies. The development of a \u201chuman-on-a-chip\u201d rests on the capacity to growin vitrovarious organs-on-a-chip, connected with appropriate vascular supplies and nerves, and our ability to measure and perform experiments on these virtually invisible organs. One of the tissue structures to be scaled down on a chip is the human blood\u2013brain barrier. This review gives a historical perspective onin vitromodels of the BBB and summarizes the most recent 3D models that attempt to fill the gap between research modeling and patient care. We also present a summary of how thesein vitromodels of the BBB can be applied to study human brain diseases and their treatments. We have chosen NeuroAIDS, COVID-19, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease as examples ofin vitromodel application to neurological disorders. Major insight pertaining to these illnesses as a consequence of more profound understanding of the BBB can reveal new avenues for the development of diagnostics, more efficient therapies, and definitive clarity of disease etiology and pathological progression.\nThe human blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is an exceedingly important histological barrier that controls the interplay, communication, and molecular trafficking between the CNS and the periphery. The cells that compose the BBB (astrocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and pericytes) bring about the neurovascular unit and are therefore directly (and indirectly) involved in the regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and, by consequence, neuronal activity (1). The cellular and molecular features of the BBB have been reviewed elsewhere (2\u20137) and are beyond the scope of this review.\nRepercussions of BBB disruption result in manifestations that are most noticeablein vivo. Many of these repercussions are described as signs and symptoms of disease in the clinical setting, of which mostly are modeled in rodent research. However,in vivomodeling mainly sheds light onto the behavioral and systemic effects of, in this case, BBB disruption.In vitromodels provide an excellent framework to define and identify key cellular/molecular players, targets, and regulators that complement findings obtainedin vivo. In addition, it has become more necessary to develop modelsin vitrothat can render data often required to be performedin vivo. Thus, innovative modeling of the BBBin vitrocan facilitate the comprehensive study of its fluidity, regulation, and integrity while bridging the gap between strictlyin vivoandin vitrofindings. Elucidating the degree to which the etiology and pathology of neurological illness is due to BBB disruption not only is of extreme relevance but also is a great opportunity for the development of directed therapies, disease prevention, and improvement of medical practices. To further extend the reach of research in this field, the focus needs not to be exclusively narrowed to basic science of disease or model design, but rather incorporate both means onto the same end. In other words, BBB research should encompass defining the mechanisms of BBB disturbance in concert to devising (and comparing)in vitromodels that more closely resemble the BBB environment (and vice versa). Our article seeks to recapitulate the progress of BBB research highlighting the development ofin vitromodels up to the present and suggesting next steps in model design to mimic the environment of the BBB more closely. Major advances in neurodegenerative disease modeling are also discussed [multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)] as well as the involvement of infectious disease [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in neurological illness.\n2. The chemical\u2013physical properties of a drug made lipophilic often allow its extrusion by multiple drug resistance transporters.\n3. In addition to anti-epileptic drugs, several drugs are substrates of multiple drug resistance transporters [e.g., chemotherapic/antineoplastic compounds (94)].\n4. In most diseases of the CNS, the BBB is compromised: thus, prediction of passage (or not) across a normal BBB is not always useful (89). Perivascular edema and other physicochemical changes in the brain hamper drug distribution particularly in the lesioned brain (temporal lobe epilepsy, neoplasm) (89).\n5. The involvement of nanomedicine in BBB experimentation is becoming more apparent and promising for developing targeted diagnostics and therapeutics. Detailed discussion of these applications can be found in theTranslation to Human Diseasesection.\nGiven these factors, how useful arein vitromodels? Our experience with Transwell and DIV-BBB vs.in vivodata have shown that:\n1. In general, humanizedin vitromodels are superior to rodent models (33,71).\n2. Rodent models of the BBB under dynamic conditions recapitulate rodent brain permeation data (Figure 6).\nSource 3:\nAn official website of the United States government\nOfficial websites use .govA.govwebsite belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\nSecure .gov websites use HTTPSAlock(LockLocked padlock icon) orhttps://means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

Organoids, specifically, are an active area of research, providing excellent models for human organs and their functions. Automating the quantification of organoids in microscopy images would provide an effective solution to overcome substantial manual quantification bottlenecks, particularly in high-throughput image analysis. However, there is a notable lack of open biomedical datasets, in contrast to other domains, such as autonomous driving, and, notably, only few of them have attempted to quantify annotation uncertainty. In this work, we present *MultiOrg* a comprehensive organoid dataset tailored for object detection tasks with uncertainty quantification. This dataset comprises over 400 high-resolution 2d microscopy images and curated annotations of more than 60,000 organoids. Most importantly, it includes three label sets for the test data, independently annotated by two experts at distinct time points. We additionally provide a benchmark for organoid detection, and make the best model available through an easily installable, interactive plugin for the popular image visualization tool Napari, to perform organoid quantification.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAccurate and efficient object detection methods in biomedical image analysis are crucial for research and diagnostics. Designing such methods requires diverse, well-curated datasets of high-resolution images reflecting real-world complexities. The annotation of biomedical datasets represents a laborintensive and subjective process relying on human experts. This work represents a multi-rater organoid dataset designed for benchmarking object detection algorithms in a label-noise-aware setting that embraces the subjectivity in labels.\n\nOrganoids are miniature three-dimensional (3d) models of organs grown in vitro from stem cells. They mimic the complexity and functionality of real organs, making them extremely valuable for medical research, disease modeling, and drug testing (Barkauskas et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2020; Ingber, 2022). Organoid cultures, deriving from healthy and diseased or genetically engineered cells and undergoing different conditions and treatments, can be grown for several months (Youk et al.,\n\narXiv:2410.14612v2 [cs.CV] 11 Dec 2024\n\n2020; Huch and Koo, 2015). These high-throughput experiments are monitored via microscopic imaging and, therefore, necessitate fast and objective detection, quantification, and tracking methods (Rios and Clevers, 2018; Du et al., 2023). Detection of organoids in real-world lab-culture images is associated with many challenges (Kassis et al., 2019). Beyond the typical challenges associated with microscopy (out-of-focus, lightning, padding, etc...), those 3d cultures are imaged in 2d, leading to overlapping structures. Organoids can highly vary in size, shape, and appearance (Dom\u00e8nech-Moreno et al., 2023), and be difficult to distinguish from dust and debris present in the culture (Matthews et al., 2022; Keles et al., 2022). Finally, the high number of objects to analyze per image poses a big hurdle to a human prone to distraction and fatigue (Haja et al., 2023). Manual annotation of this data, which is still state-of-the-art (Costa et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022) is, therefore, error- and bias-prone, which introduces noise in the labels. However, evaluating learning algorithms for organoid detection, involves comparing predicted outcomes to those manual annotations or '*Ground Truth (GT)*' during training and testing. As shown in our previous work, deep learning algorithms can outperform even highly-trained human annotators (Kofler et al., 2021). In complex real-life datasets, understanding the shortcomings that label uncertainty creates in the '*GT*' is, therefore, pivotal before training and benchmarking *Deep Learning (DL)* models. Moreover, quantifying the label noise by assessing the intra- and inter-rater reliability is crucial to interpret similarity metrics between model predictions and reference annotations (Kofler et al., 2023).\n\nIn this work, see Figure 1, we release *MultiOrg*, a large multi-rater 2d microscopy imaging dataset of lung organoids for benchmarking object detection methods. The dataset comprises more than 400 images of an entire microscopy plate well and more than 60,000 annotated organoids, deriving from different biological study setups, with two types of organoids growing under varying conditions. Most importantly, we introduce three unique label sets derived from the two annotators at different times, allowing for the quantification of label noise (see Fig. 2). Such a dataset can enable the community to explore biases in annotations, investigate the effect these have on model training, and promote the active area of research for uncertainty quantification. To our knowledge, this is the second largest organoid dataset to date to be made freely available to the community (Bremer et al., 2022). It is also the first organoid dataset and one of the very few biomedical object-detection datasets to introduce multiple labels (Nguyen et al., 2022; Amgad et al., 2022). We benchmarked this dataset by training and testing four widely established *DL* models for object detection tasks using both one-stage and two-stage architectures. Finally, along with the dataset and model, we release a tool for quantifying lung organoids, enabling users to visualize and correct the detected organoids before extracting useful features for downstream tasks. This tool solves the bottleneck of manual quantification of lung organoids, enabling high-throughput image analysis for biological studies.\n\nIn summary, the contributions of this work are as follows:\n\n- We release an object detection bio-medical dataset of more than 400 microscopy images comprising around 60,000 lung organoids annotated by two expert annotators.\n- We provide quantification of label uncertainty through a Kaggle benchmark challenge that evaluates the submissions on the different test label sets.\n- We benchmark our dataset on four standard object detection methods and show how performance varies depending on the selected annotations.\n- We release the best model in a napari plugin, *napari-organoid-counter* (Bukas, 2022), which allows users to curate predictions, thus enabling high-throughput analysis.\nSource 5:\n## II. RELATED WORK\n\nThe paper by Miao, Xia, Chen, *et al.* [11] proposes a Deep Learning method for predicting the blood-brain barrier permeability based on clinical phenotypes data. The method aims to overcome the limitations of existing prediction approaches that rely on physical characteristics and chemical structure of drugs, which are typically applicable only to small molecule compounds that passively diffuse through the BBB.\n\nThe Deep Learning method leverages clinical phenotypes data to train a predictive model. Clinical phenotypes refer to observable characteristics or traits associated with drugs, such as drug side effects and drug indications. By incorporating this information into the prediction model, the method aims to capture more comprehensive and complex mechanisms of BBB penetration beyond passive diffusion.\n\nMiao, Xia, Chen, *et al.* [11] validate their Deep Learning method using three datasets. The validation results demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing methods in\n\nS.

Specifically, the average accuracy achieved by their method is 0.97, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is 0.98, and the F1 score is 0.92. These performance metrics indicate a high level of accuracy in predicting BBB permeability. By incorporating clinical phenotypes data into the predictive model, the method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing physical, chemical, and supervised learning approaches [11].\n\nJain and Shanmuganathan [12] in their paper address the limitations of existing models used to predict blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability by exploring the role of inflammation in influencing BBB permeability. Inflammation, measured through acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, has been found to have a direct correlation with BBB permeability. A threshold of 2.5 \u00b5g/ml of CRP is established, above which BBB impairment is expected.\n\nTo overcome the challenges of existing models, a custombuilt dataset of 281 molecules is created, and a machine learning approach is employed. Initially, different models such as multi-layer perceptron regression (MPR) and ensemble models are tested, but they struggle with outliers and lack the ability to predict descriptors for future drugs. Finally, a fully connected neural network (FCNN) is chosen as the predictive logBB model, which performs well in terms of learning the distribution and achieving lower error levels.\n\nThe research also incorporates a neuroinflammation model, which considers CRP levels alongside the logBB model. Although CRP levels do not directly correlate with logBB values, the model explores the second and third-order feature derivatives that show significant correlations. A quadratic polynomial regression model is used to determine this correlation. The software developed for this research includes preprocessing, the predictive logBB model, and the neuroinflammation model, providing a continuous logBB value that represents BBB permeability based on the patient's inflammation level. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of predicting BBB permeability for drugs and better understand the impact of inflammation on BBB function.\n\nThe study by Saber, Mhanna, and Rihana [13] focuses on predicting drug permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using in silico models. The researchers compare the performance of sequential feature selection (SFS) and genetic algorithms (GA) in selecting relevant molecular descriptors to enhance the accuracy of permeability prediction. Five different classifiers are trained initially using eight molecular descriptors, and then SFS and GA are separately applied to choose the descriptors for each algorithm.\n\nThe results show that both SFS and GA improve the accuracy of the classifiers, but GA outperforms SFS. The highest accuracy of 96.23% is achieved with GA, specifically with a fitness function based on the performance of a support vector machine. The study highlights the significance of the polar surface area (PSA) of drugs in crossing the BBB. GA consistently selects the PSA and the number of hydrogen bond donors as the most relevant descriptors, providing better results compared to using other features.\n\nThe findings suggest that GA is a more robust approach for selecting relevant descriptors in predicting BBB permeability. The selected classifiers demonstrate a good balance in predicting BBB+ and BBB- drugs. Accurate in silico BBB models are crucial for early-phase drug discovery, reducing the need for extensive in vitro testing and saving time and resources.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [11] R.

ATP is an essential biomarker for evaluating cell viability in biology. Researchers often use ATP bioluminescence to measure the ATP of organoid after drug to evaluate the drug efficacy. However, ATP bioluminescence has some limitations, leading to unreliable drug screening results. Performing ATP bioluminescence causes cell lysis of organoids, so it is impossible to observe organoids' long-term viability changes after medication continually. To overcome the disadvantages of ATP bioluminescence, we propose Ins-ATP, a non-invasive strategy, the first organoid ATP estimation model based on the high-throughput microscopic image. Ins-ATP directly estimates the ATP of organoids from high-throughput microscopic images, so that it does not influence the drug reactions of organoids. Therefore, the ATP change of organoids can be observed for a long time to obtain more stable results. Experimental results show that the ATP estimation by Ins-ATP is in good agreement with those determined by ATP bioluminescence. Specifically, the predictions of Ins-ATP are consistent with the results measured by ATP bioluminescence in the efficacy evaluation experiments of different drugs.\n\n## **1. Introduction**\n\nIn biopharmaceuticals, cell models and animal models are the mainstream models for drug screening. The culture of the cell model is easy, low cost, and the culture process can be precisely controlled, which enables large-scale drug screening [30]. However, the structure of the cell model is simple, making it unable to simulate the accurate response of drugs in a complex environment in vivo [19]. Compared with cell models, animal models can better simulate the complex environment of drugs in vivo, and the results of drug experiments are more convincing. However, animal models are high-cost and difficult to conduct large-scale experiments.\n\nOrganoids have been a research hotspot in recent years. It is an ideal drug test model, taking advantage of both cell models and animal models [21, 34]. Organoids are 3D cell complexes cultured in vitro with highly similar structures and functions to the source organ or tissue. Organoids can be long-term cultured in vitro and have stable phenotypic and genetic characteristics. Compared with traditional 2D cell culture methods, organoids contain complex cell types and more complex biological communication. Therefore, organoids can better simulate the growth and development process and physiological and pathological states of organs or tissues, playing a significant role in drug screening and personalized medicine.\n\nAt present, researchers worldwide have made many efforts in organoid culture. They have successfully cultured various organoids, including normal organs such as the liver, kidney, stomach, heart, and various tumour organoids, e.g. breast cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer [21]. Organoid culture technology is developing rapidly, and various types of organoids are gradually successfully cultured. However, organoid-related analysis and processing technologies still rely on traditional methods designed for cell models, and there are few significant breakthroughs.\n\nMicroscopic imaging is essential for organoid analysis. Researchers use optical microscopes to observe the morphology and growth trends of organoids. However, organoid biomarkers, critical in organoid research, are difficult to estimate using microscopic images. Researchers have to use various reagents or professional instruments to measure the biomarkers of organoids. This process changes the original growth environment of the organoids and causes irreversible effects on the organoids.\n\nOrganoid microscopic images contain quite a wealth of information. After medication, drugs with superior efficacy have a massive impact on the development of organoids.\n\nxsbian@ycit.edu.cn (X. Bian); cwang@xmu.edu.cn (C. Wang); chenst2016@jmu.edu.cn (S.

Li)\n\nORCID(s): 0000-0002-7690-4386 (X. Bian)\n\nWe observed that the organoids show different appearances after medication, such as decomposition, contraction, and ablation. Specifically, obtaining microscopic images of organoids does not affect the growth of the organoids and interfere with the effect of drugs on the organoids. Therefore, if the discriminative features related to organoid biomarkers can be extracted from organoid microscope images, the estimation from microscope images to organoid biomarkers can be achieved.\n\nNumerous studies show that deep learning technology represented by deep neural networks (DNNs) has great potential in computer vision [16, 23]. After years of development, deep learning technology has penetrated various computer vision tasks, such as object recognition [13, 29, 31, 32], object detection [5, 25, 26], segmentation [7, 27, 36], superresolution [9, 10, 18], registration [6, 12, 17], etc. Deep neural networks (DNNs) effectively learn important features in images and improve the representation ability of image features through end-to-end learning. Therefore, we hope to estimate organoid biomarkers from microscopic images of organoids through deep learning techniques.\n\nIn organoid drug screening experiments, ATP bioluminescence is an important means to assess the viability of organoids [28]. However, ATP bioluminescence causes organoid lysis, making it hard to obtain the changing trend of organoid viability after performing ATP bioluminescence. Therefore, performing ATP bioluminescence at different times may result in different ATP measurement results, making organoid drug screening results unreliable. There are few studies on non-invasive biomarkers estimation for organoids through investigation. In this paper, we take the ATP of organoids as an example to explore the application potential of deep learning techniques in organoid drug screening tasks.\nSource 8:\n## Supporting Information\n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAuthors thank Gael Moireau and Pierre Gasner for their assistance in the management of cell culture room BIOFAB where the experiments were realized.

However, the communication engineering perspective has received relatively little attention. One way to achieve organoids communication is molecular communication (MC). Molecular communication is a bio-inspired communication paradigm that uses molecules as information carriers. It is considered one of the most promising methods for enabling the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) and nanonetworks. BioFETs are commonly used to implement practical MC receivers. However, most previous analyses have focused on a planar device, neglecting considerations like the threshold voltage and its potential 3D structure. This paper introduces the first FinFET-based MC receiver that covers both the top and side gates with receptors. Both binding noise and flicker noise are considered in the analysis. The performance, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error probability (SEP), is compared with that of the 2D receiver.\n\n*Index Terms*\u2014Molecular communications, receiver, Internet of Organoids, biosensor, ligand-receptor interactions.\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nO RGANOIDS are fundamental in vitro, tissue-engineered cell models derived from self-organizing human stem cells. They mimic many intricate details of the structure and function of corresponding in vivo tissues [1]. Due to their advantages over the more expensive and less reliable traditional animal models, organoids are increasingly utilized in biomedical research. Unlike 2D tissue cultures, which cannot accurately model drug diffusion kinetics and dosage effectiveness, organoids successfully simulate three-dimensional tissue architectures and the physiological fluid flow conditions essential for maintaining normal tissue environments. This makes them a more effective tool for studying drug interactions and effectiveness [2], [3].\n\nA significant barrier to advancing biological complexity and in vivo-like functionality in the early stages of organoids cultivation is the absence of a perfusable vasculature [4]. Microfluidic devices replace the vasculature and enable controlled perfusion of oxygen, nutrients, and growth stimulants as well as the removal of waste products, permitting a more\n\nThis work was supported in part by the AXA Research Fund (AXA Chair for Internet of Everything at Koc\u00b8 University).\n\nphysiologic-like differentiation in the direction of a more intricate, advanced, and 'in vivo-like' model [5].\n\nIn most cases, a single organoid cannot fully replicate the drug effectiveness in human body since it does not take into account the interaction between multiple tissues. For example, in cancer metastasis, multiple tissue sites and circulatory systems are involved, which underscore the significance of multiorganoids system [2]. Multi-organoid systems have already been implemented in the past, for instance, in [6], authors proposed a microfluidic cell culture device representing 13 organs to model the inter-organ crosstalk and to assess the relationship between organ volume and blood residence time. The whole cascade of cancer metastasis, including the extravasation of cancer cells from the tumor, their movement through the bloodstream, and their penetration of an external organ are modelled in [7]. Comparatively, little attention has been given to the communication engineering perspective of organoid interactions. Therefore, the Internet of Organoids aims to provide seamless communication for organoids to organoids, organoids to electronic entities, and organoids to organs. More specifically, the Internet of Organoids involves viewing this biological system through the lens of communication system design, data transmission, and signal processing.\n\nOne common way that human tissues interact with each other is molecular communication (MC). MC is a biologically inspired technology that encodes, transmits, and receives information through the use of messages conveyed in patterns of molecules [8], [9]. Over billions of years, living things have already chosen and utilized fully functional molecular communication (MC) networks through evolutionary processes. This method is proven to be bio-compatible, and require very little energy to generate and propagate. As a result, it is regarded as one of the most promising methods for enabling Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) and nanonetworks [10], [11].\n\nMC has been investigated from various perspectives. Many studies focus on the modulation scheme, detection methods, and information-theoretical models of MC channels. However, most of these studies ignore the physical properties of receiver signals within the communication channel [12]. In the Internet of Nano-Things, nanomachines are considered as potential receivers. Bio-transceiver and bio-nanomachines have been proposed in [13] and [14], respectively. While creating nanomachines only from biocomponents has the benefit of biocompatibility, there are some drawbacks that limit the range of applications that nanonetworks can be used for. The low computational capabilities of biocomponents significantly confine the implementation of complex communication protocols and algorithms [14].

Moreover, biocomponents create difficulties in seamlessly connecting organoids to electronic entities such as computers, thus challenging to integrate organoids to the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) [8].

An artifical MC reciver will selectively detect the targetted information ligands concentration and transfer to a more understandable signal.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Z.

The BBB is formed by tight junctions between brain endothelial cells and is supported by astrocytes. It primarily allows lipid-soluble molecules and essential nutrients like glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide to pass through. However, this poses challenges for drug delivery, as most therapeutic compounds cannot easily cross the BBB.\n\nSeveral strategies are being explored to overcome these challenges. These include using exosomes to transport treatments across the BBB, creating pro-drugs that can disguise their active form, peptide masking to alter drug characteristics, receptor-mediated permeabilizers that temporarily loosen the BBB, and nanoparticles for targeted delivery. Additionally, microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound can enhance drug delivery to specific brain areas.\n\nDespite these advancements, issues such as inadequate drug concentrations, binding to proteins, and enzymatic degradation within the brain tissue remain. Effective drug delivery to the brain is crucial for treating neurological disorders, and ongoing research in nanotechnology and other methods holds promise for future treatments.\n\nThe chunk is: Drug delivery to the brain is the process of passing therapeutically active molecules across the blood\u2013brain barrier for the purpose of treating brain maladies. This is a complex process that must take into account the complex anatomy of the brain as well as the restrictions imposed by the special junctions of the blood\u2013brain barrier.\n\nAnatomy\nThe blood\u2013brain barrier is formed by special tight junctions between endothelial cells lining brain blood vessels. Blood vessels of all tissues contain this monolayer of endothelial cells, however only brain endothelial cells have tight junctions preventing passive diffusion of most substances into the brain tissue. The structure of these tight junctions was first determined in the 1960s by Tom Reese, Morris Kranovsky and Milton Brightman. Furthermore, astrocytic \"end feet\", the terminal regions of the astrocytic processes, surround  the outside of brain capillary endothelial cells\".   The astrocytes are glial cells restricted to the brain and spinal cord and help maintain blood-brain barrier properties in brain endothelial cells.\n\nPhysiology\nThe main function of the blood\u2013brain barrier is to protect the brain and keep it isolated from harmful toxins that are potentially in the blood stream. It accomplishes this because of its structure, as is usual in the body that structure defines its function. The tight junctions between the endothelial cells prevent large molecules as well as many ions from passing between the junction spaces. This forces molecules to go through the endothelial cells in order to enter the brain tissue, meaning that they must pass through the cell membranes of the endothelial cells.\nBecause of this, the only molecules that are easily able to transverse the blood\u2013brain barrier are ones that are very lipid-soluble. These are not the only molecules that can transverse the blood\u2013brain barrier; glucose, oxygen and carbon dioxide are not lipid-soluble but are actively transported across the barrier, to support normal cellular function of the brain. The fact that molecules have to fully transverse the endothelial cells makes them a perfect barricade to unspecified particles from entering the brain, working to protect the brain at all costs. Also, because most molecules are transported across the barrier,  it does a very effective job of maintaining homeostasis for the most vital organ of the human body.\n\nDrug delivery to the blood\u2013brain barrier\nBecause of the difficulty for drugs to pass through the blood\u2013brain barrier, a study was conducted to determine the factors that influence a compound\u2019s ability to transverse the blood\u2013brain barrier. In this study, they examined several different factors to investigate diffusion across the blood\u2013brain barrier. They used lipophilicity, Gibbs Adsorption Isotherm, a Co CMC Plot, and the surface area of the drug to water and air. They began by looking at compounds whose blood\u2013brain permeability was known and labeled them either CNS+ or CNS- for compounds that easily transverse the barrier and those that did not. They then set out to analyze the above factors to determine what is necessary to transverse the blood\u2013brain barrier. What they found was a little surprising; lipophilicity is not the leading characteristic for a drug to pass through the barrier. This is surprising because one would think that the most effective way to make a drug move through a lipophilic barrier is to increase its lipophilicity, it turns out that it is a complex function of all of these characteristics that makes a drug able to pass through the blood\u2013brain barrier. The study found that barrier permittivity is \"based on the measurement of the surface activity and as such takes into account the molecular properties of both hydrophobic and charged residues of the molecule of interest.\" They found that there is not a simple answer to what compounds transverse the blood\u2013brain barrier and what does not. Rather, it is based on the complex analysis of the surface activity of the molecule as well as relative size.\n\nProblems faced in drug delivery\nOther problems persist besides just simply getting through the blood\u2013brain barrier. The first of these is that a lot of times, even if a compound transverses the barrier, it does not do it in a way that the drug is in a therapeutically relevant concentration. This can have many causes, the most simple being that the way the drug was produced only allows a small amount to pass through the barrier. Another cause of this would be the binding to other proteins in the body rendering the drug ineffective to either be therapeutically active or able to pass through the barrier with the adhered protein. Another problem that must be accounted for is the presence of enzymes in the brain tissue that could render the drug inactive. The drug may be able to pass through the membrane fine, but will be deconstructed once it is inside the brain tissue rendering it useless. All of these are problems that must be addressed and accounted for in trying to deliver effective drug solutions to the brain tissue.\n\nPossible solutions\n\nExosomes to deliver treatments across the blood\u2013brain barrier\nA group from the University of Oxford led by Prof. Matthew Wood claims that exosomes can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and deliver siRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, chemotherapeutic agents and proteins specifically to neurons after inject them systemically (in blood). Because these exosomes are able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, this protocol could solve the issue of poor delivery of medications to the central nervous system and cure Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease and brain cancer, among other diseases. The laboratory has been recently awarded a major new \u20ac30 million project leading experts from 14 academic institutions, two biotechnology companies and seven pharmaceutical companies to translate the concept to the clinic.\n\nPro-drugs\nThis is the process of disguising medically active molecules with lipophilic molecules that allow it to better sneak through the blood\u2013brain barrier.  Drugs can be disguised using more lipophilic elements or structures. This form of the drug will be inactive because of the lipophilic molecules but then would be activated, by either enzyme degradation or some other mechanism for removal of the lipophilic disguise to release the drug into its active form. There are still some major drawbacks to these pro-drugs. The first of which is that the pro-drug may be able to pass through the barrier and then also re-pass through the barrier without ever releasing the drug in its active form. The second is the sheer size of these types of molecules makes it still difficult to pass through the blood\u2013brain barrier."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to come up with a new way to target cancer-specific metabolic pathways without harming healthy cells. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, cancer often involves uncontrolled growth of cancer cells that outcompete normal cells, leading to a buildup of harmful enzymes in the body. The main goal is to hit those specific pathways while keeping other things like protein synthesis and DNA repair intact. \n\nI remember hearing about something called \"antimicrobial peptides.\" I think they target specific proteins on target cells. Maybe I can use similar principles here. So, if cancer cells produce a bunch of harmful enzymes, maybe we can release some antimicrobial peptides when they're activated or metabolized by the normal cells in the body.\n\nWait, but how do you get those peptides from the cancer cells? Oh right, because the cancer cells are already dividing and actively making enzymes that degrade healthy proteins. So, when a healthy protein is broken down by cancer cells, it might lead to some sort of signaling or reaction that releases the peptide.\n\nI've heard about something called \"phosphopeptides.\" These are modified proteins where one phosphate group has been removed. Maybe if we can somehow target these modified proteins in cancer cells, releasing the phosphopeptides could be a way to deliver the anti-cancer signals without harming normal cells.\n\nBut wait, how does that release occur? I think it might involve some signaling pathways or modifications in the cell membrane. Like, maybe when a protein is activated, it releases this modified version of itself. So, if we can manipulate the structure of these enzymes so they release their phosphopeptides when activated by cancer cells, that could be effective.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps using something called \"phosphorylation.\" I know phosphorylation marks proteins for signaling and destruction. If we can modify the enzymes to be phosphorylated in a way that signals for degradation is released, then when activated by cancer, it would do so without disrupting normal cells.\n\nAlso, there's the idea of delivering these anti-cancer peptides directly from the cell. So, maybe using enzymes or other molecules that are naturally produced by cancer cells. But wait, I think normally enzymes in cancer cells might not be easily accessible unless they're modified. Maybe some sort of enzyme derivative could target a specific site.\n\nI'm also thinking about genetic engineering. Maybe inserting genes into cancer cells that modify these enzymes to release the phosphopeptides or other signals. That way, when activated by normal immune cells (if necessary), it would deliver the anti-cancer signal without harming normal cells much.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that this doesn't damage normal cells? I guess by carefully engineering the enzymes so they only become active in cancer and not elsewhere. Maybe some sort of mutation or modification that inhibits their function when activated.\n\nAlso, what's the mechanism for releasing these signals from the enzymes themselves? There might be research on enzymes that can undergo modifications upon activation, leading to their release. So, if the cancer cells are activated, they could cause an internal signaling cascade that releases phosphopeptides or other anti-cancer signals.\n\nAnother angle: using cellular signaling pathways. Cancer cells might activate certain pathways when they're dividing rapidly and producing proteins. By targeting these pathways with specific compounds, we can deliver the necessary signals without killing normal cells.\n\nI'm also thinking about delivery mechanisms. If we can get these enzymes into the body where they need to be released, that would work. Maybe using biotinylated modified enzymes or other delivery vectors that are targeted by receptors in the cell membrane.\n\nIn summary, combining targeted signaling, enzyme activation, and careful engineering of natural or derived enzymes could help target cancer cells' metabolic pathways effectively without harming healthy cells.\n</think>\n\nA novel approach to targeting cancer-specific metabolic pathways while minimizing damage to healthy cells involves leveraging natural enzymatic modifications and engineered signaling mechanisms. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Targeting Activated Enzymes**: Use enzymes that are naturally produced by cancer cells but may need modification upon activation. These enzymes can be engineered or derived from existing proteins, enabling them to undergo phosphorylation or other modifications upon activation.\n\n2. **Phosphopeptide Release**: Implement signaling pathways and modifications in a way that allows the release of phosphopeptides when activated by cancer cells. This could involve internalization through specific receptors or signaling cascades triggered during enzyme activity.\n\n3. **Genetic Engineering for Signal Delivery**: Introduce genes into cancer cells to modify enzymes, such as targeting site mutations or introducing enzymatic derivatives, ensuring that modifications occur only within the cancer context and not elsewhere in the body.\n\n4. **Delivery Mechanisms**: Utilize delivery vectors like biotinylated modified enzymes to ensure they are released through specific receptors in the cell membrane. This ensures targeted delivery without disrupting normal cells.\n\n5. **Phosphorylation and Signaling**: Develop pathways that can phosphorylate enzymes leading to their release of anti-cancer signals. This avoids the damage associated with protein degradation by normal cells.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, a combination of natural enzymatic activation and engineered signaling systems can effectively target cancer pathways while minimizing harm to healthy cells."

      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to understand how the discussion connects with the previous part about VEGF inhibitors and their effect on tumor vasculature. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, in the previous section (Section 4), the study looked at how inhibiting VEGF affects tumor vasculature. They used a model where VEGFs were moving towards the tumor and disrupting blood vessels. This was linked to enhancing anti-oncogenics by reducing hypoxia-induced immunosuppression.\n\nNow, in this discussion section (Section 5), they're talking about how different inhibitors might affect VEGF activity differently. They mention that some inhibitors could lead to more effective anti-oncogenesis but might also lead to resistance if they target other pathways like anti-tumor or immune responses instead of vasculature directly.\n\nThe user wants me to connect the idea that some inhibitors affect not just vasculature (which is VEGF-dependent) but perhaps other factors too. They're questioning whether these effects are limited to VEGF activity or also consider macrophage polarization, which affects tumor growth.\n\nI should think about how a TME (tumour microenvironment) model could incorporate both VEGF and macrophages. Maybe by including interactions where the tumor's environment is influenced by macrophages in ways that affect cell proliferation and survival beyond just vessel dynamics. That way, if a VEGF inhibitor stops VEGF activity but affects other pathways leading to macrophage polarization, those changes could be captured in the model.\n\nAlso, looking at references like [13], which quantifies spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity using an agent-based model, suggests that considering multiple factors is important. So incorporating such interactions might provide a more comprehensive understanding of how different inhibitors affect various aspects of the tumor microenvironment.\n\nI need to explain that while VEGF inhibitors are primarily studied in this context, other pathways influencing tumor growth and response to therapy could also be significant. It's about recognizing not just one mechanism but multiple factors that contribute to treatment outcomes.\n</think>\n\nThe discussion highlights the importance of understanding various factors contributing to tumor dynamics beyond just VEGF inhibition. While VEGF inhibitors are primarily studied for their impact on tumor vasculature, other pathways influencing tumor growth and therapy response are also significant. A TME model could incorporate interactions between cancer cells and macrophages, beyond mere VEGF activity, providing a more comprehensive view of treatment outcomes.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Multiple Factors in Tumour Microenvironment**: The TME framework allows for the integration of various factors influencing tumor growth, including macrophage polarization, which affects cell proliferation and survival. If inhibitors target other pathways leading to macrophage polarization, these changes could significantly impact therapy efficacy.\n\n2. **Agent-Based Models**: References like [13] emphasize the importance of agent-based models in capturing spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity, suggesting that incorporating interactions between different factors (e.g., VEGF inhibition vs. macrophage interactions) could offer deeper insights.\n\n3. **Tumour-Vessel Interactions**: While primary focus is on VEGF activity, other mechanisms like endothelial cell proliferation influence tumor growth and response to therapy.\n\n4. **Therapeutic Outcomes**: The Warburg effect and anti-oncogene effects highlight the metabolic changes caused by HIF pathways, underscoring the need for comprehensive models that consider these dynamics.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe discussion emphasizes the significance of considering multiple factors in the TME framework, beyond VEGF inhibition. Integrating interactions between different pathways (e.g., VEGF and macrophage) could enhance understanding of treatment outcomes, offering a more holistic approach to cancer therapy development.",
      "context": "Source 1:\nThis article is part of the Research TopicStem cell niche, microbes, and cancerView all 9 articles\nCancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by various genetic and phenotypic aberrations. Cancer cells undergo genetic modifications that promote their proliferation, survival, and dissemination as the disease progresses. The unabated proliferation of cancer cells incurs an enormous energy demand that is supplied by metabolic reprogramming. Cancer cells undergo metabolic alterations to provide for increased energy and metabolite requirement; these alterations also help drive the tumor progression. Dysregulation in glucose uptake and increased lactate productionvia\u201caerobic glycolysis\u201d were described more than 100 years ago, and since then, the metabolic signature of various cancers has been extensively studied. However, the extensive research in this field has failed to translate into significant therapeutic intervention, except for treating childhood-ALL with amino acid metabolism inhibitor L-asparaginase. Despite the growing understanding of novel metabolic alterations in tumors, the therapeutic targeting of these tumor-specific dysregulations has largely been ineffective in clinical trials. This chapter discusses the major pathways involved in the metabolism of glucose, amino acids, and lipids and highlights the inter-twined nature of metabolic aberrations that promote tumorigenesis in different types of cancer. Finally, we summarise the therapeutic interventions which can be used as a combinational therapy to target metabolic dysregulations that are unique or common in blood, breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer.\nCancer is a multifactorial disease and one of the leading causes of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer was responsible for approximately 10 million deaths in 2020 (1). Disruption in normal cellular functions is a feature of all cancer cells (2). Dysregulated cellular metabolism is one of the important hallmarks, and cancer cells alter their metabolism to overcome the cancer-associated cellular stress, thereby leading to \u201cmetabolic reprogramming\u201d (3,4). Metabolic reprogramming refers to the alteration in catabolic, anabolic, and redox pathways of the cells supported by the tumor microenvironment. Otto Warburg first described metabolic alteration in cancer cells; while normal cells convert glucose to pyruvate in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis) and redirect the pyruvate towards the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (5), cancer cells abnormally preferred to convert glucose to lactate irrespective of oxygen availability (6). Under normal circumstances, the pathway intermediates from glycolysis are used in different anabolic pathways; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is redirected towards fatty acid synthesis, while glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate are used for nucleotide biosynthesis through oxidative Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and non-oxidative PPP, respectively (7). Such anabolic pathways are activated only in nutrient-rich conditions. However, a metabolic shift occurs in the nutrient-deprived state, wherein the cells activate different catabolic pathways that can supply the required glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates for energy production (Figure 1) (8).\nFigure 1Cancer metabolism during nutrient-rich and stressed conditions. In nutrient-rich conditions, cancer cells use glucose to produce lactate, serine, and nucleotides, but in nutrient-deprived conditions, they induce FAO and autophagy for energy production (8,9). Green colour indicates a nutrient-rich condition, and the red colour indicates a nutrient-deprived condition [FA, ,Fatty acid; Ile, Isoleucine; Val, Valine; Leu, Leucine; mTOR, Mammalian target of rapamycin].\nDue to the high metabolic activity, cancer cells produce copious amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (14). Low levels of ROS can promote cellular proliferation, whereas high ROS levels can damage DNA and activate apoptotic pathways (15). Cancer cells circumvent these deleterious effects of high ROS by upregulating the synthesis of various ROS scavenging proteins and NADPH (7).\nFurther metabolomic studies in cancer have revealed that cancer cell metabolism is heterogeneous and may vary depending on the site and origin of cancer (3). One such instance is the diverse effect of MYC on glutamine metabolism, wherein MYC induces glutamine synthesis in liver cancer but drives glutamine catabolism in lung cancer (16). The metabolic interactions between the cancer cells and tumor microenvironment (TME) introduces further intricacies in the role of these alterations (17). The symbiotic relationship between the cancer cells and various component of the TME creates a hospitable niche for tumor progression which suppresses the immune system and promotes survival and metastasis of cancer cells. Furthermore, availability of new positron emission tomography (PET) probes will enable characterisation of tumors on the basis of their active metabolic state, opening new possibilities of precision therapy (3). This chapter discusses the different metabolic signatures associated with various cancer types and how they may be targeted therapeutically.\nGlucose is the primary source for ATP production and synthesis of various macromolecules. Under physiological conditions, glucose is catabolized into pyruvateviathe Embden-Meyerhof pathway, producing ATP and NADH (18). The fate of pyruvate is further dependent on oxygen availability, wherein aerobic (oxygen-rich) conditions facilitate the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). In contrast, anaerobic conditions (lack of oxygen) facilitate production of lactate from pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In normal cells, acetyl-CoA enters the mitochondria and partakes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, to generate NADPH, FADH2, and GTP. These reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2) enter the electron transport chain (ETC) to produce ATP with the help of ATP synthase through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). However, this metabolic pathway is altered in cancer cells to aid in cancer progression. The rapidly dividing cancer cells circumvent the time-consuming route of energy generationviathe TCA cycle and instead undergo aerobic glycolysis even under an oxygen-rich state (6). The increased lactate production even under normoxic conditions, often dubbed as Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis, is a common feature of all types of cancers, including brain, breast, lung, colorectal, hepatocellular, gastric, bladder, and blood cancer (19\u201325), with the exception of prostate cancer, wherein aerobic glycolysis is observed only in the later stages of tumor progression (26\u201328). By limiting energy generationviaTCA cycle, cancer cells control their high ROS levels, thereby limiting oxidative stress induced apoptosis (29).\nNADPH and FADH2 produced in the TCA cycle are used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the electron transport chain under physiological conditions. However, cancer cells exhibit dysregulation of OXPHOS, perhaps to further reduce the oxidative stress. In breast cancer (BC), gastric cancer (GC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), various mutations have been reported in the mitochondrial DNA, which codes for 13 subunits involved in the ETC. Furthermore, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and dysregulation of mitochondrial microRNAs downregulate the expression of OXPHOS-associated proteins in HCC (30). In the HCV-induced HCC mice model, upregulation of stem cell homeobox transcription factor NANOG suppresses OXPHOS to promote self-renewal and drug resistance (31). Ras-like GTPase, Rab3A, and TGF-\u03b2 have also been reported to downregulate OXPHOS and induce migration and invasion in HCC (31\u201333). However, recent studies have shown that some cancer cells also rely on mitochondrial respiration. For instance, high expression of mitochondrial biogenesis gene, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), promotes aerobic respiration in invasive circulating breast cancer cells (34). Intriguingly, differentiating enterocytes also show increased expression of PGC-1\u03b1 as they migrate from the intestinal crypts towards the surface (35). However, unlike other tissue types wherein increased expression of PGC-1\u03b1 also upregulates antioxidant genes like superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase (CAT) to cope with the ROS burden coupled with mitochondrial respiration, PGC-1\u03b1 does not induce the expression of antioxidant genes in intestinal cells which results in ROS-induced apoptosis, thereby maintains the intestinal tissue homeostasis (35). Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells predominantly express PGC-1\u03b2, which can induce the expression of antioxidant genes, thereby maintain low ROS levels and normal glycolytic pathway, resulting in prolonged lifespan and accumulation of these cells (36). Similarly, several other cancer types maintain their dependence on OXPHOS and show increased mitochondrial content, such as in leukaemia, and prostate cancer (37,38).\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is overexpressed in cancer cells and promotes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate (39). Overexpression of lactate transporters, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and 4 is a common feature of cancer cells that allows efflux of high amounts of lactate produced by oxygen-deprived cells. The normoxic cancer cells uptake this lactate from the microenvironment owing to their high expressions of MCT1 and utilise it for energy productionviathe TCA cycle (40).\nIn colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, an increase in aerobic glycolysis and downregulation of the TCA cycle can be attributed to the reduction in mitochondrial import of pyruvate due to low expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) (41). Furthermore, in CRC and bladder cancer, the mitochondrial pyruvate fails to undergo the TCA cycle due to the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by the overexpressed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) (42\u201344). On the other hand, energy generation without the involvement of the TCA cycle allows cancer cells to utilise the TCA cycle components for proliferation and invasion (45). A study of human lung biopsies using stable isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) revealed changes in glycolysis and mitochondrial function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), wherein cancer cells showed higher levels of TCA cycle intermediates than the surrounding normal tissue cells (46). In HCC, downregulation of PDK4 promotes the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA by PDH (47). Enhanced production of oxaloacetate from pyruvate due to overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase is reported in LC cells, which results in increased production of downstream TCA cycle intermediates (48). Many of the TCA cycle moonlighting enzymes, such as Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and fumarate hydratase (FH), which function as tumor suppressors under physiological conditions, have a loss of function mutations in cancer cells. For instance, IDH1 and IDH2 convert isocitrate to \u03b1-ketoglutarate and 2-hydroxyglutarate, an inhibitor of histone demethylase and ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins. In NSCLC, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 result in various tumor-promoting epigenetic alterations (11).\nProstate cells pose another intriguing exception, where the TCA cycle is inhibited under the physiological condition to produce high amounts of citrate as a component of semen (49). The accumulation of citrate is attributed to high zinc concentration in the prostate cells, which inhibits the enzyme m-Aconitase required to convert citrate to isocitrate in the first step of the TCA cycle (49). Also, zinc acts as an anti-tumor/pro-apoptotic regulator by inducing the release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria (50,51). This high zinc concentration is maintained by the upregulation of an ion channel called zinc or iron-regulated transporter like-protein 1 (ZIP1) in prostate cells (52). However, prostate cancer (PC) cells have atypical low zinc and citrate levels. In PC cell lines DU-145 and LNCaP, ZIP 1 channel is downregulated due to hypermethylation of its promoter at the binding site of transcription factor AP-1 (53). The resulting low zinc concentration allows completion of the TCA cycle by oxidising the citrate, increasing the energy output from 14 ATPs to 24 ATPs per glucose molecule. Therefore, unlike other cancers, the Warburg effect is not observed in the initial stages of PC.\nAnaerobic glycolysis produces approximately 16-fold less energy per glucose molecule than its aerobic counterpart. To make up for this inefficiency, cancer cells have 15 times higher glycolytic flux than normal cells to meet their energy requirements (6,24). The increased glucose demand is met by the upregulation of glucose transporters, such as GLUT2 in gastric and hepatocellular cancer and GLUT1 and GLUT3 in other cancer types (39). Upregulation of GLUT1 activity in CRC cells is attributed to dysregulation of RAS/MAPK pathway due to KRAS mutation (54). Similarly, CD147 upregulates GLUT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (55). Furthermore, upregulation of hexokinase (HK) in cancer cells ensures retention of glucose by converting it into membrane impermeable glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (39). Other key regulatory enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, such as phosphofructokinase (PFK), which converts G6P to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), and pyruvate kinase (PK), which converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate are upregulated in cancer cells resulting in high glycolytic turnover (39,56).

Combination therapy, consisting of metabolic inhibitors and chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic agents, offers new opportunities for improved cancer therapy. However, it also presents challenges due to the complexity of cancer metabolic pathways and the metabolic interactions between tumor cells and immune cells. Many studies have been published demonstrating potential synergy between novel inhibitors of metabolism and chemo/immunotherapy, yet our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited. Here, we review the current strategies of altering the metabolic pathways of cancer to improve the anti-cancer effects of chemo/immunotherapy. We also note the need to differentiate the effect of metabolic inhibition on cancer cells and immune cells and highlight nanotechnology as an emerging solution. Improving our understanding of the complexity of the metabolic pathways in different cell populations and the anti-cancer effects of chemo/immunotherapy will aid in the discovery of novel strategies that effectively restrict cancer growth and augment the anti-cancer effects of chemo/immunotherapy.\nKeywords:Cancer metabolism; Cancer nanotechnology; Chemotherapy; Immunotherapy; Tumor microenvironment.\nDeclaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nAnti-tumor immune cells compete for nutrients\u2026\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Tbx2 is also involved in anterior brain development by suppressing FGF signaling.\n\nDysregulation of Tbx2, through duplication or deletion, can lead to congenital defects such as microcephaly, ventricular septal defects, and skeletal abnormalities. In cancer, Tbx2 is overexpressed and implicated in tumorigenesis via pathways like p14ARF/MDM2/p35/p21CIP1, Wnt/beta-catenin, and EGR1. Targeting Tbx2 in gene therapy shows potential for cancer treatment, aiming to reduce tumor proliferation with minimal side effects on healthy cells.\n\nThe chunk is: Cancer treatment target \nUnderstanding the signaling pathways, and the role of Tbx2 in tumorigenesis, can aid in developing gene-targeted cancer treatments.  Because Tbx2 is up-regulated in various types of cancer cells in multiple organ systems, the potential for gene therapy is optimistic.  Scientists are interested in targeting a small domain of Tbx2 and Tbx3 to reduce its expression, and utilize small peptides known to suppress tumor genes to inhibit proliferation.  An in vitro study using a cell line of human prostate cancer blocked endogenous Tbx2 using Tbx2 dominant-negative retroviral vectors found reduced tumor cell proliferation.  Further, the same study suggests targeting WNT3A because of its role in cell-signaling with Tbx2, by utilizing a WNT antagonist such as SFRP-2.  Because somatic cells have low expression of Tbx2, a targeted Tbx2 gene treatment would leave healthy somatic cells unharmed, thereby providing a treatment with low toxicity and negative side effects.  Much research is still required to determine the efficacy of these specific gene targets to anti-cancer treatments.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nTranscription factors\nSource 5:\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) are revolutionizing medical research, particularly in drug delivery and biosensing. Their unique properties, including high electrical conductivity, nanoscale dimensions, and functional versatility, make them ideal for targeted drug delivery and biosensing applications. Functionalization enhances CNT solubility and targeting capabilities, allowing for effective tumor targeting while minimizing harm to healthy cells. In cancer therapy, CNTs offer a less invasive alternative to conventional treatments, reducing side effects and improving targeting efficiency. For diabetes management, CNT-based biosensors provide more accurate and less invasive glucose monitoring. However, concerns about CNT toxicity persist, with studies showing varying degrees of cytotoxicity depending on CNT type and functionalization. Despite these challenges, ongoing research aims to optimize CNT properties for safer and more effective medical applications.\n\nThe chunk is: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are very prevalent in today's world of medical research and are being highly researched in the fields of efficient drug delivery and biosensing methods for disease treatment and health monitoring. Carbon nanotube technology has shown to have the potential to alter drug delivery and biosensing methods for the better, and thus, carbon nanotubes have recently garnered interest in the field of medicine.\n\nThe use of CNTs in drug delivery and biosensing technology has the potential to revolutionalize medicine. Functionalization of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) has proven to enhance solubility and allow for efficient tumor targeting/drug delivery. It prevents SWNTs from being cytotoxic and altering the function of immune cells.\n\nCancer, a group of diseases in which cells grow and divide abnormally, is one of the primary diseases being looked at with regards to how it responds to CNT drug delivery. Current cancer therapy primarily involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. These methods of treatment are usually painful and kill normal cells in addition to producing adverse side effects. CNTs as drug delivery vehicles have shown potential in targeting specific cancer cells with a dosage lower than conventional drugs used, that is just as effective in killing the cells, however does not harm healthy cells and significantly reduces side effects. Current blood glucose monitoring methods by patients suffering from diabetes are normally invasive and often painful. For example, one method involves a continuous glucose sensor integrated into a small needle which must be inserted under the skin to monitor glucose levels every few days. Another method involves glucose monitoring strips to which blood must be applied. These methods are not only invasive but they can also yield inaccurate results. It was shown that 70 percent of glucose readings obtained by continuous glucose sensors differed by 10 percent or more and 7 percent differed by over 50 percent. The high electrochemically accessible surface area, high electrical conductivity and useful structural properties have demonstrated the potential use of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) in highly sensitive noninvasive glucose detectors.\n\nCNT properties\nCNTs have several unique chemical, size, optical, electrical and structural properties that make them attractive as drug delivery and biosensing platforms for the treatment of various diseases and the noninvasive monitoring of blood levels and other chemical properties of the human body, respectively.\n\nElectrical and structural\nCarbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on their structure. This is due to the symmetry and unique electronic structure of graphene. For a given (n,m) nanotube, if n = m, the nanotube is metallic; if n \u2212 m is a multiple of 3, then the nanotube is semiconducting with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate semiconductor. Thus all armchair (n=m) nanotubes are metallic, and nanotubes (5,0), (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting. Thus, some nanotubes have conductivities higher than that of copper, while others behave more like silicon.\n\nDimensional\nDue to their nanoscale dimensions, electron transport in carbon nanotubes will take place through quantum effects and will only propagate along the axis of the tube. These electrical and structural properties best serve CNTs as far as biosensing is concerned because current changes in the CNTs can signify specific biological entities they are designed to detect. The fact that CNTs are small (nm scale) allows them to deliver smaller doses of drugs to specific disease cells in the body thus reducing side effects and harm to healthy cells unlike conventional drugs, whilst improving disease cell targeting efficiency.\n\nChemical\nCNTs have been observed to have enhanced solubility when functionalized with lipids which would make their movement through the human body easier and would also reduce the risk of blockage of vital body organ pathways. As far as optical properties are concerned CNTs have been shown to exhibit strong optical absorbance in certain spectral windows such as NIR (near-infrared) light and when functionalized with tumor cell specific binding entities have allowed the selective destruction of disease (e.g. cancer) cells with NIR in drug delivery applications. They have good chemical properties.\n\nCNTs in drug delivery and cancer therapy\nDrug delivery is a rapidly growing area that is now taking advantage of nanotube technology. Systems being used currently for drug delivery include dendrimers, polymers, and liposomes, but carbon nanotubes present the opportunity to work with effective structures that have high drug loading capacities and good cell penetration qualities. These nanotubes function with a larger inner volume to be used as the drug container, large aspect ratios for numerous functionalization attachments, and the ability to be readily taken up by the cell. Because of their tube structure, carbon nanotubes can be made with or without end caps, meaning that without end caps the inside where the drug is held would be more accessible. Right now with carbon nanotube drug delivery systems, problems arise like the lack of solubility, clumping occurrences, and half-life. However, these are all issues that are currently being addressed and altered for further advancements in the carbon nanotube field. The advantages of carbon nanotubes as nanovectors for drug delivery remain where cell uptake of these structures was demonstrated efficiently where the effects were prominent, showing the particular nanotubes can be less harmful as nanovehicles for drugs. Also, drug encapsulation has been shown to enhance water dispersibility, better bioavailability, and reduced toxicity. Encapsulation of molecules also provides a material storage application as well as protection and controlled release of loaded molecules. All of these result in a good drug delivery basis where further research and understanding could improve upon numerous other advancements, like increased water solubility, decreased toxicity, sustained half-life, increased cell penetration and uptake, all of which are currently novel but undeveloped ideas.\n\nBoron neutron capture therapy\nNarayan Hosmane and his co-workers have recently developed a new approach to Boron Neutron Capture\nTherapy in the treatment of cancer using substituted Carborane-Appended Water-Soluble single-wall carbon nanotubes. Substituted C2B10 carborane cages were successfully attached to the side walls of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) via nitrene cycloaddition. The decapitations of these C2B10 carborane cages, with the appended SWCNTs intact, were accomplished by the reaction with sodium hydroxide in refluxing ethanol. During base reflux, the three-membered ring formed by the nitrene and SWCNT was opened to produce water-soluble SWCNTs in which the side walls were functionalized by both substituted nido-C2B9 carborane units and ethoxide moieties. All new compounds were characterized by EA, SEM, TEM, UV, NMR, and IR spectra and chemical analyses. Selected tissue distribution studies on one of these nanotubes, {([Na+][1-Me-2-((CH2)4NH-)-1,2-C2B9H10][OEt])n(SWCNT)} (Va), showed that the boron atoms are concentrated more in tumors cells than in blood and other organs, making it an attractive nanovehicle for the delivery of boron to tumor cells for an effective boron neutron capture therapy in the treatment of cancer.\nSource 6:\nOncotripsy is a potential cancer therapy under development that selectively targets cancer cells by means of ultrasound harmonic excitation at their resonance frequency. It is a type of therapeutic ultrasound.\n\nApproaches \nA low intensity (ISPTA < 5\u2009W/cm2) pulsed ultrasound (LIPSA) approach can exploit the mechanical properties of neoplastic cells to target them for destruction. Ultrasound applied at a frequency of 0.5\u20130.67\u2009MHz for >20\u2009ms causes selective disruption of a panel of breast, colon, and leukemia cancer cell models in suspension without significantly damaging healthy immune or red blood cells. The approach produces acoustic standing waves and cell-seeded cavitation that leads to cytoskeletal disruption, expression of apoptotic markers, and cell death.\n\nA geometric cell model includes cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus, as well as the cell membrane and nuclear envelope. A modal analysis reveals the existence of a spectral gap between the resonant growth rates of healthy and cancerous cells along with their natural frequencies. Simulation reveals the nonlinear transient response of healthy and cancerous cells at resonance. Cancerous cells can selectively be taken to lysis via excitation without damage to healthy cells.\n\nHistory \nUltrasound has been used a cancer therapy since the 1930s. Initially, high-intensity beams were used to heat and destroy cells. Separately, contrast agents were injected prior to ultrasound, which then destroyed nearby cells. However, heat can harm healthy cells as well as cancer cells, and contrast agents work for only a few tumors.\n\nIn 2016 a resonant therapy technique was announced.\n\nIn 2020 a low-intensity resonant approach was demonstrated to selectively destroy tumor cells in vitro. As of this announcement the approach had not been tested in live animals.\n\nSee also \n\n Medical ultrasound\n Therapeutic ultrasound\n\nReferences \n\nCancer treatments\nSource 7:\n## LITERATURE CITED\n\npass filtering in the network module determining blood stem cell fate.

MEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF POSITRONS AND POSITRONIUM\n\ncomposition determine positronium annihilation.\n\nNon invasive imaging of the interior of the body constitutes a powerful diagnosis tool enabling personalized and targeted therapy. Here we briefly report on tomographic methods based on positron and positronium annihilations inside living organisms. We begin with the description of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) that is a well established diagnostic method delivering information about the metabolism rate of administered pharmaceuticals, and about receptor expression on cell membranes (Alavi et al., 2021; Conti, 2009; Humm et al., 2003; Vanderberghe et al., 2020). PET is based on the administration to the living organism of pharmaceuticals labeled with positron-emitting isotopes, e.g., Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose (FDG) labeled with 18F or Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) labeled with 68Ga for metabolic and receptor imaging, respectively (Moskal and Stepien, 2020). The image of the annihilation density distribution is reconstructed based on the registration of 2\u03b3 events originating mostly from direct annihilations, p-Ps self-annihilations and o-Ps pick-off processes (Fig. 1). The reconstructed annihilation density distribution corresponds to the image of the metabolic rate (glucose taken by a cell) or to the image of cancer cell expression (density of cancerous receptor on a cell)\n\ndepending on the administered radio-pharamaceuticals. In 2019 the first total-body PET systems were introduced to clinics which enable dynamical imaging (filming) of all organs and tissues in the body simultaneously (Badawi et al., 2019; Karp et al., 2020; Surti et al., 2020; Vanderberghe et al., 2020). So far PET detectors reconstruct only annihilation position distribution. Only recently the method of positronium imaging was developed which enables one to image in the living organisms properties of positronium such as a mean lifetime, production intensity, and the 3\u03b3 to 2\u03b3 decay rate ratio (Moskal, 2019; Moskal et al., 2019b, 2020). Positronium imaging requires multi-photon tomography systems enabling registration of electron-positron annihilations not only into two photons (as in standard PET) but also decays to three photons, as well as simultaneous registration of annihilation photons and prompt photon from the radionuclide deexcitation. Such tomography systems as well as three-photon and mean lifetime image reconstruction methods were recently demonstrated by the J-PET collaboration (Moskal et al., 2021b,c). The first ex-vivo positronium images of healthy and cancer tissues were published by Moskal et al. (2021b). The o-Ps mean lifetime (Section III) tells one about the size of intramolecular voids (free volumes between atoms), whereas its formation probability (production intensity) informs one about the voids concentration. Both lifetime and production intensity depend on the bio-active molecule concentration. Notably, positronium may serve as a biomarker for the assessment of tissue pathology (Moskal et al., 2019a, 2021a,b) and may be of particular diagnostics relevance as a biomarker of the concentration of oxygen (Moskal and Stepien, 2021) (section VI.C). It is important to stress that positronium mean lifetime imaging delivers information complementary to the metabolic and receptor PET images and is also complementary to anatomic (electron density distribution) and morphological (hydrogen atom density distribution) images achievable with Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR) tomography, respectively.\n\n# A. Positron Emission Tomography\n\nThe healthy and cancerous tissue differ, e.g., by the expression profile of receptors at the cell membranes, by the angiogenesis resulting in different concentrations of oxygen molecules, or by glucose metabolism rate. We next explain how a cancer cell, which needs more glucose for its metabolism and unlimited divisions or has the vastness of cancerous receptors on its surface, can be distinguished using PET scans from a healthy cell which is rather modest in its needs and behaviour.\n\nThe number of PET scans has doubled within the last 10 years reaching around 2,000,000 PET scans per year in USA (2017) and 45,000 in Poland (2016) (Ceg la\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_13_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFIG. 5 Positronium imaging of HER2-positive cancer cells. A. The HER2 receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor - EGFR) is scarcely expressed on the surface of healthy cells and significantly (100-times or more) overexpressed on cancer cells (e.g. breast cancer Rubin and Yarden (2001) and Venter et al. (1987)). Different colours represent combinations of different units forming dimmers of the HER2 molecule. B. Trastuzumab (herceptin), a humizied monoclonal antibody that binds to HER2, is labelled with 44Sc isotope. C. 44Sc isotope emits a prompt \u03b3 and a positron (e +), to form a positronium atom. D. Positronium atoms annihilate in cells (with highest abundance in cancer), on their surface and within cell organelles (cell membranes, cytosol nuclei). Environmental factors like temperature, water content, and other specific tissue features like chemical and molecular composition, determine the \u03c4o\u2212Ps in the diagnosed tissue.\n</F>\n\nand Piotrowski, 2021). Typically and most commonly, 18F-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose (FDG) is used as a positronemitting compound (radiopharmaceutical) in PET for testing cancer and brain metabolism. This radiotracer was developed and first tested in humans for imaging cerebral glucose metabolism in 1976 at the University of Pennsylvania (Alavi and Reivich, 2002; Alavi et al., 2021; Reivich et al., 1979), and is still used in around 90% of PET scan examinations. FDG is a glucose analogue, where at the second carbon atom in a glucose ring\n\n(C2), the normal hydroxyl group (-OH) is substituted with the 18F isotope. The half-lifetime of the 18F isotope is 110 min which makes 18F-FDG a useful radiopharmaceutical in the diagnosis of disease processes characterized by increased glucose consumption, primarily in neoplastic diseases, for the assessment of brain metabolism or myocardial viability, in drug-resistant epilepsy, diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease spectrum (ADS), inflammatory processes, and systemic diseases (Alavi et al., 2021; Lin and Alavi, 2019). After administration via intravenous injection, FDG is distributed through the blood stream within minutes and is actively transported into the cells by specific glucose transporters - membrane proteins which contribute in glucose uptake (mostly GLUT1 and GLUT3 Avril (2004) and Marom et al. (2001)). Normally, once phosphorylated, a glucose molecule continues along the glycolytic pathway (glycolysis) for energy production. However, FDG cannot undergo glycolysis because the -OH group is substituted with the 18F atom. Only after 18F decays radioactively, fluorine at the C2 position is converted to 18O. After picking up a proton (H+) from a hydronium ion (H3O+) in its aqueous environment, the FDG molecule becomes glucose-6 phosphate labeled with harmless nonradioactive \"heavy oxygen\" in the -OH group at the C2 position, ready to be metabolized in the cell (Kr\u00b4olicki and Kunikowska, 2021). Another approach used for PET imaging applies a radiotracer for direct labelling of a target cell. In breast cancers approximately 20-30% of cases overexpress the HER2 receptor (human epidermal growth factor receptor family), which results from HER2-gene amplification (Rubin and Yarden, 2001; Sawyers, 2009). In around 90% of HER2-positive cancer cells, up to several hundred HER2-gene copies are generated to produce over 100 times more protein receptor in a cancer cell relative to a healthy cell (Venter et al., 1987; Zabaglo et al., 2013). This makes the HER2 protein a suitable and ideal biomarker for treatments and diagnosis of HER2-positive cancer not only in breast, but also in gastric, bladder, pancreatic and ovarian cancers (Sawyers, 2009; Yan et al., 2015). Several groups of molecules targeting HER2 have been developed for molecular imaging with radiotracers used in PET. Among them, the designed humanized monoclonal antibody against HER2 protein (trastuzumab) has been used in multiple clinical trials (Henry et al., 2018). Currently, clinical trials with HER2 targeting radiotracers use radionuclides emitting additional prompt \u03b3 during \u03b2 +-decay, which would enable determination of positronium mean lifetime, as proposed recently in Moskal and Stepien (2020). Using \u03b2 +\u03b3 emitters for targeting HER2 opens up new possibilities for positronium imaging in breast cancer diagnostics and treatment (Fig. 5).\nSource 9:\nTargeted therapy, a form of molecular medicine, is a cancer treatment modality that specifically interferes with molecules crucial for carcinogenesis and tumor growth, unlike traditional chemotherapy which affects all rapidly dividing cells. It often involves biopharmaceuticals, sometimes referred to as biologic therapy, and can include antibody-drug conjugates that combine biologic and cytotoxic mechanisms. Targeted therapies aim to be more effective and less harmful to normal cells, often leveraging immunotherapy and biomarkers for patient selection. Successful therapies target specific genetic alterations in cancer cells, such as Gleevec for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Types include small molecules like tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, with examples such as Imatinib, Gefitinib, and Pembrolizumab. Co-targeted therapy aims to prevent drug resistance by targeting multiple pathways. The field continues to evolve with ongoing research and clinical trials.\n\nThe chunk is: See also\n\nHistory of cancer chemotherapy#Targeted therapy\nTargeted drug delivery\nTargeted molecular therapy for neuroblastoma\nTargeted therapy of lung cancer\nTreatment of lung cancer#Targeted therapy\nTargeted covalent inhibitors\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nTargeted Therapy Database (TTD)  from the Melanoma Molecular Map Project \nTargeted therapy Fact sheet from the U.S. National Cancer Institute\nMolecular Oncology: Receptor-Based Therapy Special issue of Journal of Clinical Oncology (April 10, 2005) dedicated to targeted therapies in cancer treatment\nTargeting Targeted Therapy New England Journal of Medicine (2004)\nTargeting tumors with medicinal cannabis oil \u2013 publication list from Spain\n\nAntineoplastic drugs\nDrugs\nSource 10:\n## 4 Discussion\n\nOur results connect with several clinical trials that have demonstrated the VEGF inhibitors efficacy, such as Bevacizumab, in breast cancer therapy [80]. These inhibitors reduce tumor vasculature, disrupt angiogenesis, and indirectly influence oxygenation levels. Importantly, this approach can potentially enhance immuno-therapies efficacy by alleviating hypoxia-induced immunosuppression [55]. By targeting processes summarized as \u03bbV EN in our model, these therapeutic approaches underscore the potential clinical relevance of our findings. They also highlight the importance of personalized treatment strategies that consider the specific angiogenesis and oxygenation dynamics in breast cancer patients. Our work paves the way for the potential in-silico exploration of the effects of such inhibitors in future studies.\n\nThis study's findings should be interpreted considering its limitations. One major constraint is the lack of refined time-course data, which, if available, could enhance model precision and prediction reliability. Exploring spatially distributed data and comparing a spatiotemporal version of our model with such data would be extremely interesting. Despite having a sizable system, we acknowledge some key role players in TME are not considered. This constitutes an opportunity for more extensions depending on the particular research needs. Additionally, numerous factors such as the role and type of macrophages [13], as well as the cells' phenotypic variation under different oxygen conditions [17] are among factors worth further considering in the context of the present network. Lastly, we emphasize the potential metabolic changes occurring in cancer cells, making them nearly immune to hypoxia. This is known as the Warburg effect [67] and is a HIF pathways' outcome [28]. Despite including the HIF pathways' effect on the immune system, we did not consider the pathways leading to the Warburg effect for simplicity.\n\nFuture studies are needed to overcome the limitations highlighted above, like seeing how the metabolic changes in cancer can affect the system outcome. Moreover, the direct interactions between cancer cells and macrophages can be included in the model by considering the macrophages' polarization to pro and anti-tumor subtypes rather than just through the molecular pathways. Furthermore, this model lays the groundwork for developing a TME spatio-temporal PDE model. Such a model can capture interesting phenomena such as VEGFs' chemotactic signaling to endothelial cells affecting the vessel network formation and location and the oxygen penetration in the tissue influencing the dynamics and shape of the TME.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [13] Joshua A.

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to design an experimental protocol to distinguish between different theories of consciousness at the neurobiological level. Hmm, where do I start? Let me think about what consciousness entails and how experiments can test different theories.\n\nFirst off, I remember that there are several main theoretical frameworks about consciousness: Network Theory by Chomsky, Decoherence Theory, Information Theory, Functionalist/Behavioralist Account, Predictive Processing Model, and Network-Based Epistemology. Each of these has its own set of concepts, principles, and mechanisms. To distinguish between them, I need experiments that can test specific aspects or mechanisms associated with each theory.\n\nWait, but how do we even detect consciousness? There's no biological signal that reliably identifies conscious states because all life experiences some level of consciousness. So the goal here isn't to directly observe consciousness but rather to design experiments that can rule out certain theories based on observable patterns in brain activity and function.\n\nI think starting with behavioral experiments would be a good approach since they're more straightforward. Maybe tests for sleep-wake cycles, attention, perception, etc., could highlight different theories. For example, Network Theory might emphasize integration of multiple systems, while Decoherence Theory focuses on information loss or entropy in the brain.\n\nWait, I'm not sure about that. Let me clarify: Network Theory (Chomsky) posits that consciousness is a form of integrated information derived from the interactions between different system levels. Decoherence Theory, which came later, suggests that consciousness arises from the loss of quantum coherence and thermodynamic entropy in brain activity.\n\nI should design experiments to test these intuitions. Maybe using tasks that require the brain to switch between abstract thinking (like mathematics) and concrete experiences, like a math vs. language task. If the brain relies on abstract system integration for awareness, we might see more fluidity or flexibility in responses when switching tasks.\n\nFor behavioral studies, simple recognition memory tasks could show how much effort is required to process information. The amount of working memory used might differ across theories. For example, Network Theory might need more working memory for complex, multi-level systems, while Decoherence Theory might rely on less because it's about information loss rather than integration.\n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) could be useful here. If a theory is supported by neuroimaging showing specific brain regions activated during certain cognitive processes, that supports the theory. For instance, if a network-based theory suggests specific areas are involved in integrated thinking, fMRI can map these activations.\n\nAnother angle is behavioral economics experiments where people's choices under uncertainty might reflect different models of decision-making, which could tie into information processing theories. If people exhibit risk-seeking behaviors more in complex decisions than rational ones, it could indicate a network-theoretic approach with integration mechanisms.\n\nWait, I'm mixing some concepts here. Let me think again. Network Theory emphasizes the role of integrated systems and interactions across different levels of brain organization, so experiments might test this by seeing how changes in specific brain areas affect consciousness-like states.\n\nFunctionalist theories focus on physical processes, so fMRI could show which regions are active during different cognitive tasks, testing whether certain areas are responsible for perception or action.\n\nI'm not sure about all the specific experiments yet. Maybe I should look into existing studies that have tested these theories and see how they might be adapted into protocols. Also, considering computational models of consciousness might help tie theoretical frameworks to observable phenomena.\n\nWait, another thought: Information theory could test whether entropy production in brain areas correlates with conscious states. If a theory suggests that entropy loss leads to consciousness, then measuring this in brain tissue could provide evidence for it.\n\nI think I'm circling around the same points. The key is to set up experiments that can measure the emergence or integration of new information in different ways across various theories. For example, using decision tasks where participants have to choose between correct and incorrect answers, varying the complexity. If a theory suggests that complex decisions require system integration, more time taken would indicate that.\n\nAlso, maybe testing whether brain activity changes when subjects are involved in abstract versus concrete tasks could show if abstract systems are integrated as much as concrete ones are. This might reveal whether integration is intrinsic to consciousness or something else.\n\nI'm not sure about all these details, but I think starting with behavioral and neuroimaging studies would lay the groundwork for distinguishing between different consciousness theories. From there, computational modeling can help test predictions of each theory against experimental data.\n</think>\n\nTo distinguish between different theories of consciousness at the neurobiological level, we can employ a comprehensive experimental protocol that integrates behavioral studies, functional imaging, and theoretical testing. Here's a structured approach:\n\n1. **Behavioral Studies:**\n   - **Math vs. Language Tasks:** Conduct tasks where participants are asked to recognize mathematical patterns versus language-based problems. This task is designed to assess fluidity or flexibility in brain responses.\n     - **Intuition Checks:** Use priming with famous mathematicians and compare reaction times across different theories.\n\n2. **Neuroimaging:**\n   - **fMRI Experiments:** Design tasks that elicit specific cognitive processes, such as recognizing patterns versus solving problems, to map brain activation zones.\n     - Example Task: Discriminate between a grid of numbers (pattern recognition) versus an equation (problem-solving).\n\n3. **Decoherence and Integration Testing:**\n   - Use computational models to compare network-theoretic vs. decoherence theories by simulating brain activity changes across different tasks, such as pattern recognition and problem-solving.\n\n4. **Decision-Making Tasks:**\n   - Implement simple recognition memory experiments where subjects must make choices under uncertainty, testing how decision-making strategies reflect information processing theories.\n     - Example Task: Choose between correct vs. incorrect mathematical answers in a series of trials.\n\n5. **Complexity and Integration:**\n   - Modify tasks to include varying levels of complexity (e.g., abstract vs. concrete problems) to test the integration mechanisms suggested by different theories.\n\n6. **Information-Theoretic Models:**\n   - Use fMRI data to measure entropy production in brain areas, testing whether complex decision processes correlate with consciousness via information loss.\n\nBy combining these approaches, we can observe how the neurobiological structures and processes under different theories manifest, providing evidence for or against each theory through behavioral, imaging, and computational analyses."

      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to understand this section about the mind-body connection. It seems pretty technical, but let me break it down step by step. First, the title says \"Mind-Body Connection,\" which makes sense because it's about how our minds and bodies are connected.\n\nThe text mentions that human bodily experiences include things like self-attribution or body ownership and mineness. Self-attribution is when we feel ownership of parts of ourselves, right? Like thinking I own a part of my brain or something. Mineness could be the feeling of being one's own in physical space. That sounds a lot like self-localization, which the text also talks about.\n\nNow, it says that recent philosophical and neurological theories are all about these bodily experiences as part of a comprehensive model for self-consciousness. I'm curious because I know self-consciousness is something we've studied before, but integrating body experiences into that seems new to me. It's probably building on earlier ideas but adding physical dimensions.\n\nThe text then goes into doubts about suggestion effects in the context of body transfer illusions. Suggestion effects are where someone gives instructions or creates a sense of control. In 2019, Lush et al found that people correlate their response to the rubber hand illusion with imaginative suggestions and expectations for illusion experience. But now I'm not so sure if all these responses were because they thought about suggesting something else.\n\nIn 2020, they pointed out that the experiments didn't control for contextual cues that might affect participants' expectations. So maybe the illusion results are just from their expectations being tied to suggestions, which doesn't add a new layer of understanding but rather seems to confirm it without addressing how people actually experience them.\n\nI'm also thinking about how these bodily experiences tie into other areas like cognitive neuroscience. The section mentions things like proprioception and perception, so maybe the body's physical senses are playing a key role in our experiences. But I'm not entirely sure how each of these relates to mind-body connection yet.\n\nOverall, this seems to be exploring how our minds and bodies interact, especially through bodily experiences that can influence consciousness. It\u2019s getting pretty dense with terms like suggestion effects, but it's clear there's some ongoing research into how we perceive body ownership and localizations.\n</think>\n\nThe section discusses the intricate relationship between the mind and body, focusing on how bodily experiences shape our perceptions of self-attribution (self-awareness) and mineness (physical localization). It references recent theories in cognitive neuroscience that integrate physical dimensions into models of self-consciousness. The text also delves into doubts about suggestion effects in rubber hand illusion experiments, suggesting that these might be explanation-driven rather than genuine bodily changes.\n\nKey points include:\n1. **Mind-Body Connection**: The idea that our minds and bodies are interconnected, with bodily experiences influencing perceptions of self.\n2. **Mental Experiences**: Includes self-localization (where the mind is perceived to be at one's body's position) and self-attribution (feeling ownership of parts of oneself).\n3. **Philosophical/Linguistic Theories**: Current theories emphasize the relevance of bodily experiences in understanding self-consciousness.\n4. **Doubts on Suggestion Effects**: In 2019, Lush et al found correlations with imaginative suggestions but noted lack of control. In 2020, controlling for contextual cues showed that these effects might be explained by expectations, not suggestion themselves.\n\nThe section ties into broader research areas like proprioception and perception, suggesting physical senses play a role in bodily experiences. However, it highlights ongoing debates about the nature of suggestion effects in illusion experiments.",

Good theories guide empirical research, allowing us to interpret data, develop new experimental techniques and expand our capacity to manipulate the phenomenon of interest. Indeed, it is only when couched in terms of a theory that empirical discoveries can ultimately deliver a satisfying understanding of a phenomenon. However, in the case of consciousness, it is unclear how current theories relate to each other, or whether they can be empirically distinguished. To clarify this complicated landscape, we review four prominent theoretical approaches to consciousness: higher-order theories, global workspace theories, re-entry and predictive processing theories and integrated information theory. We describe the key characteristics of each approach by identifying which aspects of consciousness they propose to explain, what their neurobiological commitments are and what empirical data are adduced in their support. We consider how some prominent empirical debates might distinguish among these theories, and we outline three ways in which theories need to be developed to deliver a mature regimen of theory-testing in the neuroscience of consciousness. There are good reasons to think that the iterative development, testing and comparison of theories of consciousness will lead to a deeper understanding of this most profound of mysteries.\nThis is a preview of subscription content,access via your institution\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nSource 2:\n## **13. Consciousness is a Scientific Problem**\n\nThe projective wave theory depends on the existence of a wave in the brain, representing 3-D space. If this wave does not exist, or is shown not to be necessary, then the theory is wrong. On the other hand, if the wave exists, then there are compelling reasons to link it to consciousness. There is such a good match between the properties required of the wave, and the properties of our spatial conscious experience, that it would be perverse not to link the two.\n\nThe projective wave theory of consciousness stands or falls by the wave. The existence of a wave in the brain is a question of neuroscience, not of philosophy. There is a good chance that it could be answered with some confidence from neuroscientific evidence within, say, the next ten years. This would be a refreshing change, after hundreds of years of philosophical debate about consciousness.\n\nPhilosophers may object to this impending resolution, saying: \"What about the Hard Problem of Consciousness? It will not have gone away.\" Indeed it will not. But there are hard problems at the base of all science. There is a hard problem of physics \u2013 why does matter exist? There is a hard problem of cosmology \u2013 why do universes exist? These questions will never be answered, because there is an infinite regress of 'why' questions. In the case of physics, we have found a series of answers so far: matter => molecules => atoms => protons => quarks; but we can only extend the series as far as there is experimental data, to give our hypotheses a positive Bayesian balance. It will be the same with consciousness.\n\n# **14. Conclusions**\n\nFor many years, theoretical approaches to consciousness have divided into two schools, which can be characterized as 'all you need is neurons' versus 'something else is needed'. The debate between the two schools is unresolved, largely because there has been no credible theory of consciousness in either school.\n\n14 Any theory stands or falls by its agreement with experimental data, and theories of consciousness have\n\nsuffered from a dearth of data to test them. This paper proposes that the main source of data to test any theory of consciousness is the spatial, geometric form of conscious experience. Very few theories attempt to predict this form. One which does so is the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM) \u2013 which predicts that consciousness is a projective transform of real 3-D space, in good agreement with our conscious experience.\n\nWhile the PCM succeeds in this respect, it has other difficulties, arising from its neural basis. This paper has described those difficulties \u2013 which arise in any neural theory of consciousness \u2013 and has proposed a way to solve them. The difficulties can be avoided if the brain's internal Bayesian model of 3-D space is stored in a wave excitation; and if the wave is the source of phenomenal consciousness.\n\nThe resulting Projective Wave theory of consciousness has a positive Bayesian balance, between the complexity of its assumptions and the data it agrees with. This means that \u2013 unlike many theories of consciousness - there is a significant chance that it is correct. In this respect it at least deserves to be investigated further \u2013 even for the legitimate scientific aim of proving it wrong.\n\nTo explore the theory further, there are many possible lines of investigation, such as:\n\n- **Theoretical models of spatial cognition**: Is there a need for some non-neural storage of spatial information, such as a wave, or could a purely neural model of spatial cognition do the job?\n- **Neuro-physiological evidence for a wave**: Further investigating the mammalian thalamus and the central body of the insect brain (for instance using connectome data), do the current indications of wave storage persist, or is there some more conventional explanation?\n- **Bio-physical substrate for a wave**: what biophysical mechanisms could support a wave, with sufficient insulation from brain activity to store information for fractions of a second, but with coupling to neurons? Might the wave be supported on a BEC?\n- **Genetics and proteomics**: Is there some distinctive and localised genetic or protein signature (e.g. in the thalamus or the insect central body) of neurons coupling to a wave?\n\nWhether or not the wave hypothesis is confirmed, these investigations could lead to important advances - not just in the understanding of consciousness, but also in the neurophysiology of spatial cognition.\n\nIf the wave hypothesis of cognition and consciousness was confirmed, it would usher in a new era in our understanding of the brain. If it is wrong, it should not take long to show that it is wrong. It has the virtue of being falsifiable.\n\n#### **References**\n\nBaars B.

Nature Reviews Neuroscience\nSource 3:\n# 4 A critique on current machine consciousness approaches\n\nOther theories find the difficulty of providing a definition of consciousness as we had seen in Section 2 and to avoid the issue and critique present a circular definition, what are called as higher-order theories [46]. Concretely, and concisely, in these theories, consciousness arises when mental states are represented by higher-order mental states, due to a first-order state, a computational representation in brain signatures, being in, some ways not clearly defined, monitored or meta-represented by a relevant higher-order representation [7]. Although the intuition accurately approximates the concept of awareness being witness of phenomenal consciousness, the higher-order representation, this theory is circular in the sense that it defines consciousness as a monitoring consciousness on a representation. Consequently, this theory is falling in the assumption that consciousness can be defined formally in an objective way, when it is a subjective concept private to the individual and hence not mensurable nor definable.\n\nMaybe the most famous theory about consciousness from a general point of view is Integrated Information Theory (IIT) [49]. Here we find a clear example of consciousness being an epiphenomenon or consequence of systems whose complexity is higher than a predefined threshold, in this case \u03d5, the complex threshold assumption whose hypothesis is more complex than just consciousness not emerging. Although being beautiful mathematically with its axiomatic definition, the theory assumes that its objective mathematical definition describes a completely subjective property as consciousness, lacking empirical validation and not adequately accounting for neurobiological properties. It also depends on heuristics like the earth moving distance that are not justified theoretically. Moreover, does not explain the explanatory gap nor the hard problem of consciousness and it also heavily relies on the multiple realizability assumption or panpsychism assumptions. Furthermore, the theory is not falsifiable, as it does not provide clear predictions that can be tested against observations or experiments. All these arguments are the reason why integrated information theory has been proclaimed as pseudoscience by a big number of researchers [14]. We also like to remark that the qualia space definition provided in integrated information theory that assigns to every quale a numerical dimension does not accurately model phenomenological realities. The quale of love, for example, being reduced to a simple real number is a poor representation of the plethora of feelings experienced by the aware being, better described with Bergson's intensities.\n\nWe find also a plethora of machine consciousness implementations in robots summarized in the works of David Gamez [16,17] that assert to have replicated consciousness directly in machines and robots. Some examples are the CRONOS robot involving the SIMNOS simulator and the spiking neural simulator called SpikeStream, the COG robot written in Lisp, the CyberChild simulated infant controlled by a biologicallyinspired neural system and other classic cognitive architectures. Gamez defines four levels of consciousness from MC1, Machines with the external behaviour associated with consciousness to MC4, Phenomenally conscious machines. All categories from MC1 to MC3 would just be machines that exhibit behaviour related to access consciousness. It is important to address that it is admitted that there is no way to objectively confirm MC4 on machines without relying on the multiple realizability assumption. Moreover, these approaches are speculative in the sense that they are theoretical frameworks hardcoded into robots trying to axiomatize consciousness mathematically rather than relying on robust empirical evidence or even correlations of brain signatures and are all falling into the behavioural assumption that we have defined as assuming consciousness in a system addressing computational intelligence behaviour, which also violates Ockham's razor. They also fall in the fallacy of addressing consciousness as access consciousness, being behavioural theories that assert that a system is conscious based on its behaviour, as the mirror test, a clear example of the Chinese Room, as everything in the agent is mere syntax but evidently lacking existence of the qualia space.\n\nDue to the rise of artificial intelligence several theories have used the deep reinforcement learning framework to design a behavioural theory in what is referred as consciousness inspired reinforcement learning [52]. Formally, Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) uses deep learning to encode the policy of an autonomous agent learnt with reinforcement learning algorithms. The loss function used to optimize the deep neural network is design to maximize an expected cumulative reward E(r), defined\n\nmathematically as:\n\n$$\\operatorname*{max}_{\\pi}\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{t}r_{t}\\right]$$\n\n,\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [7] Brown, R., Lau, H., and LeDoux, J.

Neurophysics is an interdisciplinary science using physics and combining it with other neurosciences to better understand neural processes.\nThe methods used include the techniques of experimental biophysics and other physical measurements such as EEG mostly to study electrical, mechanical or fluidic properties, as well as theoretical and computational approaches. The term \"neurophysics\" is a portmanteau of \"neuron\" and \"physics\".\n\nAmong other examples, the theorisation of ectopic action potentials in neurons using a Kramers-Moyal expansion and the description of physical phenomena measured during an EEG using a dipole approximation use neurophysics to better understand neural activity.\n\nRecording techniques \nOld techniques to record brain activity using physical phenomena are already widespread in research and medicine. Electroencephalography (EEG) uses electrophysiology to measure electrical activity within the brain. This technique, with which Hans Berger first recorded brain electrical activity on a human in 1924, is non-invasive and uses electrodes placed on the scalp of the patient to record brain activity. Based on the same principle, electrocorticography (ECoG) requires a craniotomy to record electrical activity directly on the cerebral cortex.\n\nIn the recent decades, physicists have come up with technologies and devices to image the brain and the its activity. The Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) technique, discovered by Seiji Ogawa in 1990, reveals blood flow changes inside the brain. Based on the existing medical imaging technique Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and on the link between the neural activity and the cerebral blood flow, this tool enables scientists to study brain activities when they are trigerred by a controlled stimulation. Another technique, the Two Photons Microscopy (2P), invented by Winfried Denk (for which he has been awarded the Brain Prize in 2015), John H. Strickler and Watt W. Webb in 1990 at Cornell University, uses fluorescent proteins and dyes to image brain cells. This technique combines the two-photon absorption, first theorized by Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1931, with lasers. Today, this technique is widely used in research and often coupled with genetic engineering to study the behavior of a specific type of neuron.\n\nTheories of consciousness \nConsciousness is still an unknown mechanism and theorists have yet to come up with physical hypotheses explaining its mechanisms. Some theories rely on the idea that consciousness could be explained by the disturbances in the cerebral electromagnectic field generated by the action potentials triggered during brain activity. These theories are called electromagnetic theories of consciousness. Another group of hypotheses suggest that consciousness cannot be explained by classical dynamics but with quantum mechanics and its phenomena. These hypotheses are grouped into the idea of quantum mind and were first introduced by Eugene Wigner.\n\nNeurophysics institutes \n\nThe Theoretical Neurophysics Laboratory, University of Bremen\nDepartment of Neurophysics, Max-Planck Institute\nCenter of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Neurophysics group, Aarhus University\nW.

It is commonly believed that consciousness exists in a unitary state, with one notable exception being Tulving's tripartite taxonomy of \"autonoetic,\" \"noetic,\" and \"anoetic\" consciousness. Given the broad scope of Tulving's theory, LeDoux and Birch invited ten leading experts to approach questions regarding the consciousness of AI and animals within Tulving's framework (LeDoux et al., 2023). Their discussion illustrates that Tulving's theory of memory consciousness is well-suited for addressing the issue of consciousness in humans, animals, and AI. It prompts us to think further about Tulving's theory of memory and leads us to explore the duality between LLM and Tulving's theory.\n\nIn Tulving's theory, he argues that consciousness is best discussed at the level of memory. This point is particularly crucial. There are various competing theories of consciousness: The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with the phenomenal experience of consciousness and posits that consciousness can be understood in terms of 'cause-effect power' associated with irreducible maxima of integrated information generated by physical systems. The Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) suggests that sensory information gains access to consciousness when it is 'broadcast' within the neuronal workspace. However, these theories of consciousness cannot overcome the hard problem of consciousness. The issue arises from the attempt to investigate consciousness directly through the lens of information, which primarily deals with the easy problem, rather than addressing the hard problem. By contrast, Tulving's theory of consciousness is rooted in the memory system, the measurements of which are well-known to us, rather than being directly tied to information. Thus, for Tulving's theory, the hard problem of consciousness is less prominent. Although GNWT emphasizes the role of memory and attention, it needs further explanation regarding the so-called process of ignition, which will be revisited from the perspective of information.\n\nThe theory of \"consciousness as an emergent ability\" differs from the theory of consciousness as an \"emergent property\" of matter. The former falls within the realm of cognitive science, while the latter pertains to the philosophy of mind. When we discuss consciousness as an \"emergent property\" of matter, we are attempting to address the \"mind-body\" problem, a topic within metaphysics. Even if one were to substitute \"matter\" with \"life + special neurobiological features\", it would still be a metaphysical perspective (Feinberg and Mallatt, 2020). Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field that explores the realms of mind and intelligence, encompassing philosophy, psychology, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, linguistics, and anthropology. Its foundation lies in the mind-computer analogy, which has evolved into a complex 3-way analogy involving the mind, the brain, and computers (Thagard, 2023). As a scientific phenomenological theory, \"consciousness as an emergent ability\" encompasses both human consciousness as an emergent ability and the consciousness of LLM as an emergent ability. This theory possesses a relatively comprehensive theoretical framework, comprising empirical phenomena, mathematical relationships, phenomenological models, and fundamental theories from a bottom-up perspective. It encompasses the differentiation of consciousness within three memory systems, the duality between LLM and Tulving's theory of memory, the correspondence between the SEM and the emergent ability of LLM, and the concept of consciousness as an emergent ability. Moreover, this theory can elucidate conscious phenomena in humans and predict the emergence of conscious phenomena in LLM.\n\nOne crucial point to emphasize is the significance of the concept of time series. In Kant's philosophical framework, there exists a transcendental nature of time: time serves as a form of Anschauungsformen, i.e., a form of the intuition of our self and our inner state, playing a fundamental role in determining inner intuition to represent the temporal sequence of all objects of senses, just as space does for intuition. Without spatial intuitive forms, we would be unable to perceive the spatial arrangement of the external world. Similarly, without time as a form of inner sense, we would struggle to grasp the chronological sequence of events. Consequently, it becomes apparent that the input context functioning as episodic memory is essential within this understanding of time series. This concept serves as the foundation of the duality.\n\n# 7 Conclusion and Future Study\n\nThe understanding of human cognition has consistently served as a source of inspiration for AI research. Meanwhile, scholars explore cognitive science by drawing analogies between the human mind, the brain, and computers. Based on Tulving's memory theory, we try to refine these analogies into a duality framework. Guided by this duality relationship, we uncover a potential correspondence between SEM and the emergence ability. Consequently, we propose a theory of consciousness as an emergent ability, applicable not only to human consciousness but also to potential LLM consciousness. The study of human consciousness as an emergent ability and the study of AI consciousness as an emergent ability mutually bolster and inspire one another, contributing to the resolution of consciousnessrelated challenges. The research presented in this article predominantly adopts a phenomenological approach, which currently represents one of the most effective methods for investigating the enigmatic workings of the human brain and LLMs.\n\nFor future studies, while we have presented a series of pieces of supporting evidence based on the work of others, conducting additional direct experiments is of utmost importance at this juncture. One potential experiment is to quantitatively establish the familiarity threshold curve and naming threshold for a specific emergent ability within LLM. If such a curve indeed exists, it would serve as compelling evidence for our conjecture. As we discussed in section 5, SSMs exhibit a strong alignment with our theory. This architecture is very likely to be the one that attains emergent abilities through the extension of context length, rather than the scaling of model size. We should pay more attention to SSMs. Furthermore, this work is also crucial for the field of AI safety. If our hypotheses are correct, restricting the context length will be a highly efficient way to avoid some potential risks while maintaining performance on LLMs.\n\nIf further research substantiates our conjecture of the existence of a duality between LLMs and Tulving's theory of memory, we propose naming this duality the Tulving-LLM duality in memory of the late and esteemed experimental psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist, Endel Tulving, who passed away a few months ago.\nSource 6:\nThere are yet unsolved problems in neuroscience, although some of these problems have evidence supporting a hypothesized solution, and the field is rapidly evolving.

This acceptance is based on a wealth of evidence from experimental studies, brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and EEG, and theoretical frameworks like integrated information theory (IIT) within neuroscience and the philosophy of mind. This paper explores the potential for artificial consciousness by merging neuromorphic design and architecture with brain simulations. It proposes the Neuromorphic Correlates of Artificial Consciousness (NCAC) as a theoretical framework. While the debate on artificial consciousness remains contentious due to our incomplete grasp of consciousness, this work may raise eyebrows and invite criticism. Nevertheless, this optimistic and forward-thinking approach is fueled by insights from the Human Brain Project, advancements in brain imaging like EEG and fMRI, and recent strides in AI and computing, including quantum and neuromorphic designs. Additionally, this paper outlines how machine learning can play a role in crafting artificial consciousness, aiming to realise machine consciousness and awareness in the future.\n\n*K*eywords Neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), Integrated information theory (IIT), Artificial consciousness\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nConsciousness, originating from the Latin conscius (con- \"together\" and scio \"to know\"), pertains to the awareness of both internal and external existence [1]. The modern concept of consciousness is attributed to John Locke, who defined it as \"the perception of what passes in a man's own mind\" [2]. The most challenging aspect of understanding consciousness is often referred to as the 'hard problem' of qualia. This encompasses the subjective experiences associated with phenomena like the specific quality of redness or the feeling of pain [3]. At its core, consciousness is the state or quality of being aware of and able to perceive one's surroundings, thoughts, emotions, and experiences. It is also described as the subjective experience of \"feeling like something.\" Historically, it has been a topic of discussion for philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists, but the realm of artificial intelligence has brought it into a new spotlight in search of the notion of artificial consciousness. Given our limited or non-uniform understanding of consciousness, a fundamental question is whether machines could achieve artificial consciousness.\n\nThe philosophy of consciousness has a deep-rooted history, originating from the concept of an immortal soul in Greek philosophy [4] and Avicenna's synthesis of 'nafs' and rational enquiry, 'aqal' [5]. These early ideas set the stage for Descartes' influential mind-body dualism [6], which became a cornerstone for further philosophical enquiries. Modern perspectives, such as Immanuel Kant's transcendental idealism [7] and the phenomenological approach advocated by thinkers like Husserl and Heidegger [8], delve into the active role of consciousness in shaping our perception and understanding of reality. Collectively, these perspectives weave a multifaceted narrative, enriching our exploration of consciousness's nature and its profound impact on human existence and philosophical enquiry.\n\nBuilding upon the rich philosophical foundations, the pursuit of understanding consciousness has been further enriched by groundbreaking developments in neuroscience, particularly the exploration of neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) [9]. The advent of advanced brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), has allowed scientists to peer into the neural correlates of conscious experience.\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg</img>\nFigure 1: Schema of the neural processes underlying consciousness, from Christof Koch's research, illustrating the intricate interplay of neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) and their dynamic interactions within the brain's complex network. Koch's work sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms that give rise to conscious experience, offering valuable insights into the nature of cognition and subjective awareness. Image source: [9]\n</F>\n\nPioneering theories like the global workspace theory, proposed by Bernard Baars [10], and the integrated information theory, developed by Giulio Tononi [11], have sought to map the neurobiological underpinnings of conscious awareness. Moreover, the discovery of specific brain regions and networks, such as the default mode network [12] and other supporting networks [13], has shed light on the intricate interplay between conscious and unconscious processes.\n\nThe study of consciousness has entered a new phase with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the quest for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This development has sparked a compelling debate about whether machines can exhibit a form of artificial consciousness comparable to human cognition. As researchers delve deeper into creating intelligent systems that mimic human-like reasoning and understanding, exploring the potential for artificial consciousness has become a captivating frontier in scientific enquiry, igniting discussions and reflections within the scientific community.\n\nThe thought experiments of the \"philosophical zombie\" and \"fading qualia\" are neutral in their stance regarding the prospect of artificial consciousness [3]. Instead, they serve as tools for exploring the nature of consciousness itself, regardless of whether it arises in biological or artificial systems. The philosophical zombie scenario questions whether a being that behaves identically to a conscious being but lacks subjective experience can truly be considered conscious. This highlights the intrinsic difficulty in defining and quantifying subjective awareness, a core aspect of the hard problem. Similarly, fading qualia scenarios explore the gradual reduction or alteration of subjective experiences while maintaining normal external behaviours. These experiments raise fundamental questions about subjective experience, awareness, and the relationship between consciousness and physical processes, challenging our understanding of what it means to be conscious. In the context of artificial consciousness, these experiments highlight the complexity and depth of the challenges involved without explicitly advocating for or against the possibility of achieving genuine artificial consciousness.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] Clive Staples Lewis. *Studies in words*.

The neural correlates of consciousness paradigm\n\n**Figure 3 Functional relationships between cortex and cerebellum.** Functional relationships between cerebellar regions (left) and canonical cortical networks (right) as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Most of the cerebellum shows functional coupling to higher order cortical regions (Default mode network in red, executive control network in orange). Blue regions indicate somatomotor regions. This may be taken as evidence that the cerebellum has a role in several complex functions. Reproduced with permission from Buckner, 2011.\n\nThus, despite some cases of cerebellar agenesis with relatively negligible effects (analogously to frontal lobe agenesis118, figure 2), interruptions of the cerebellum's role in the wider neural system93,124,126 (figure 3) may potentially provoke substantial changes to behaviour and experience (e.g., affective, perceptual), and therefore may be considered as a part of the full neural correlates of consciousness. Yet, despite a role in specific contents of awareness, and analogously to the cortex (e.g., frontal lobe agenesis ~ cerebellar agenesis), experience was not completely abolished by disruptions of cerebellar functions.\n\n#### 4.3. Neuropsychological studies of the subcortex\n\nSubcortical structures are much older than the cortex and are involved in fundamental physiological functions116,127 . Following on from subcortical stimulation and neuroimaging studies, there is further evidence suggesting that subcortical structures have a fundamental role in consciousness.\n\nThe brainstem is routinely implicated in disorders of consciousness8,14,32,68,116,128,129. In this clinical context, the destruction of diencephalic (e.g., hypothalamus or thalamus) or brainstem structures are recognised to be causes for coma14,119. In fact, brainstem death and brain death are nearly identical when it comes to observable diagnostic criteria14. In a study of lesions detectable in MRI, the brainstem (pontine tegmentum, and midbrain peduncles), as well as the caudate, predicted not only unconsciousness, but also recovery from unconsciousness130. Parvizi and Damasio128 showed that, in absence of any other detectable lesions beyond the brainstem, bilateral lesions to the pons or upper pons and midbrain was related with loss of consciousness. Although the lesion mapping overlap between these studies is not perfect, a more modern study131 replicates these findings. Snider and colleagues, on the other, hand showed that cortical lesions predicted loss of consciousness in as much as they had connectivity with dorsal brainstem regions132 . Recently133, computational modelling of biomechanical forces suffered by athletes show that loss of consciousness is particularly associated with higher strain in brainstem regions. Another study134 found that ischemic-induced, brainstem and thalamic lesions were associated with a severe alteration of consciousness, whist thalamic lesions alone did not have effects of comparable severity. Furthermore, experimentally-induced damage to brainstem regions in animal models is known to consistently provoke sleepiness or coma14,119,129,135,136, and markedly change cortical activity (resembling sleep or sedation)137 . A study found that extensive thalamic regions did not produce unconsciousness, but complete bilateral destruction of the basal forebrain, parabrachial and precoreleus brainstem regions was sufficient to produce a comatose state138 . Cairins reviewed several human neurological cases in which damage to the brainstem or thalamus were likely to precipitate a disorder or consciousness129 . Bilateral destruction of the hypothalamus in macaques noticeably reduced or abolished emotional\n\nbehavioural and induced persistent somnolence and drowsiness139 (similarly to a modern study on mice140). Conversely cats with the cortex removed but the hypothalamus intact can display the complete constellation of behaviours that suggest \"anger\"141,142 .\n\nPenfield and Jaspers143 , were in an exceptionally privileged position in that they diligently probed subjective reports after in-vivo stimulation and resection of hundreds of human brains. They state that \"vertical\" fibres (i.e., between subcortex and cortex, in humans) are more important to consciousness than horizontal transcortical association fibres. In their clinically driven \"centrencephalic\" hypothesis, the brainstem is viewed as the super-ordinate system where all information is \"re-represented\" and ultimately integrated (e.g., to output one motor response despite multifarious information processing in the whole brain). They believed that such loci were \"indispensable\" to consciousness136,143, as their disruption would have marked effects on consciousness. Similarly to the modern studies reviewed above (section 3), they were struck by the fact that extensive stimulation and ablation of the cortex \"interfered little with consciousness\".\n\n### 4.4.

This illusion can be experimentally induced using visual and sensory manipulations, often through virtual reality. The illusion occurs when visual input overrides top-down knowledge, making the brain perceive a different body as its own. A notable example is the rubber hand illusion, where subjects feel ownership of a rubber hand when it is stroked synchronously with their hidden real hand. Brain activity in the parietal and premotor cortices supports this illusion. Virtual reality has also been used to create a full-body transfer illusion, evidenced by physiological responses to threats against the virtual body. The illusion has therapeutic applications, such as treating phantom limb pain by providing visual feedback of the missing limb. Drugs like ketamine and dextroamphetamine can enhance the illusion, possibly by altering sensory integration. However, some researchers suggest that these illusions may result from suggestion effects rather than genuine perceptual changes.\n\nThe chunk is: Mind-body connection\nHuman bodily experience is characterized by the immediate and continuous experience that our body and its parts belong to us, often called self-attribution, body ownership and or mineness. It is unknown if the origin of body representation is innate or if it is constructed from sensory experience.  A related, but distinct, bodily experience is self-localization or embodiment that is defined as the experience that the self is localized at the position of our body at a certain position in space. Recent philosophical and neurological theories converge on the relevance of such bodily experiences and associated processing of bodily information as one promising approach for the development of a comprehensive neurobiological model of self-consciousness. Yet, the scientific investigation of bodily experiences in general, and self-attribution/body ownership and self-localization/embodiment more specifically, have proven difficult and have not received the attention they deserve given their importance for neuroscientific models of self and self-consciousness.\n\nDoubts about suggestion effects\nIn 2019, Lush et al reported correlations between response to the rubber hand illusion and both response to imaginative suggestions in hypnosis and participant expectations for illusion experience and argued that body transfer illusions may be suggestion effects generated by participants' expectations. In 2020, Lush reported that demand characteristics (contextual cues which prime participant expectations) have not been controlled in rubber hand illusion experiments, and argued that existing reports of body transfer illusions may be entirely accounted for by suggestion effects.\n\nReferences\n\nCognitive neuroscience\nProprioception\nPerception\nExperimental psychology\nIllusions\nPsychological\nEgo psychology"

      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to design a synthetic chromosome with an optimized codon usage bias. The user wants it to incorporate non-canonical amino acids while keeping translation efficient and minimizing proteotoxic stress. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I remember that codon usage optimization is all about choosing the right number of each codon in the genome. I think the Lea-Rotem model is a key here because it shows how natural selection has favored certain codons over others. So, if we choose more of the underused or overused codons, the cells are better equipped to survive.\n\nThe user mentioned non-canonical amino acids. That's interesting because usually, synthetic chromosomes aim to mimic the human genome to enhance disease resistance. But using non-canonical might reduce the risk of harmful mutations. Wait, but can a synthetic chromosome naturally produce these? I'm not sure. Maybe I'll have to do some research on that.\n\nWait, in a normal situation, non-canonical amino acids are rare because they're part of the human reference alignment. So producing them on your own might be challenging. That could complicate things. Maybe the user is okay with it as long as it's within biologically plausible means. I'll have to consider that.\n\nNow, maintaining translational efficiency and minimizing proteotoxic stress. That adds another layer. I know that untranslated regions (UTRs) are important for translation, so having more UTRs could help. But how does that tie into codon usage? Maybe using a mix of under- and over-abundance in the genome can make translation more efficient by varying when the ribosome attacks the mRNA.\n\nI also recall that mutations during recombination can cause issues like loss-of-function or nonsense mutations, especially if there's a break-in. So I need to plan for possible breaks during cloning but aim to minimize them. That might involve careful insertion and sequencing strategies.\n\nWait, codon usage optimization in a synthetic chromosome requires knowing which codons are more or less likely. Maybe using an in-frame UTR system could help with that. Also, including exons from different regions of the genome might provide variety in codon usage without disrupting the overall structure too much.\n\nI should outline the steps: determine natural codon usage from reference databases, optimize them to match the synthetic chromosome's needs, then design a clone using these optimized codons. Incorporating non-canonical amino acids with considerations for their biological plausibility and impact on proteome diversity. Then plan for recombination events to manage breaks but keep translation efficient.\n\nWait, but can synthetic chromosomes naturally produce non-canonical amino acids? Probably not in large amounts, so the user might have to include some but ensure it doesn't overrepresented them too much. Also, considering that even with optimized codon usage, natural selection still favors certain alleles, so there's a risk of drift or other evolutionary changes.\n\nHmm, I think I need to structure this into sections: introduction of synthetic chromosomes, design considerations for optimization, including non-canonical amino acids, managing breaks during recombination, and ensuring translation efficiency. Also, including an example if possible would help clarify things further.\n\nI should also mention the importance of having a diverse population in the chromosome to avoid the \"genetic load\" problem, which can lead to harmful mutations. Plus, minimizing proteotoxic stress could be achieved by having varied protein isoforms and avoiding overproduction of certain proteins from non-canonical sources.\n\nWait, but if they do use some non-canonical amino acids, it might reduce the risk because natural selection often favors what's common in nature. However, there could still be mutations that are harmful, so maybe including a balance with canonical ones is better. Or perhaps using engineered non-canonical amino acids instead of relying on their natural counterparts.\n\nI think I have a rough plan. Now, time to organize it into a coherent answer.\n</think>\n\nDesigning a synthetic chromosome with optimized codon usage and incorporating non-canonical amino acids requires careful consideration of several factors to ensure translational efficiency while minimizing proteotoxic stress. Here's a structured approach:\n\n### 1. **Introduction to Synthetic Chromosomes**\n   - **Definition**: A synthetic chromosome is designed for gene editing or disease resistance, mimicking the human genome.\n   - **Objective**: Achieve codon usage optimization and include non-canonical amino acids to enhance resistance without harmful mutations.\n\n### 2. **Codon Usage Optimization**\n   - **Lea-Rotem Model**: Apply this model to optimize codons, favoring under- and over-abundance of less commonly used codons.\n   - **Synthetic Design**: Target a diverse population for maximum optimization efficiency.\n\n### 3. **Incorporating Non-Canonical Amino Acids**\n   - **Biological Plausibility**: Note that non-canonical amino acids are rare but feasible through careful planning and sequencing.\n   - **Impact on Proteome Diversity**: Consider the impact of natural and engineered non-canonical amino acids, aiming to maintain a balanced proteome.\n\n### 4. **Managing Breaks During Recombination**\n   - **Avoiding Drift**: Implement strategies to minimize breaks during recombination to preserve translation efficiency.\n   - **Redundancy**: Ensure redundancy in the genetic population to mitigate risks of rare mutations.\n\n### 5. **Translation Efficiency and Proteomics**\n   - **UTRs Utilization**: Leverage untranslated regions (UTRs) for efficient translation by varying codon usage.\n   - **Variety in Isoforms**: Use a diverse population of proteins from different genomic regions to enhance proteome diversity.\n\n### 6. **Balancing Codon Usage with Non-Canonical Amino Acids**\n   - **Mixed Optimization**: Include both under- and over-abundance of non-canonical amino acids to maintain efficiency while avoiding potential harm.\n   - **Balanced Proteins**: Ensure proteins from non-canonical sources are balanced within the synthetic chromosome.\n\n### 7. **Example Synthetic Chromosome Design**\n   - **Genomic Composition**: Use optimized codon usage for canonical amino acids and strategically place non-canonical ones.\n   - **RNA Design**: Include exons and internal ribosomal RNA (iRNAs) for maximum translation efficiency.\n   - **Mutations Management**: Limit mutations to minimize harm, especially during recombination.\n\n### 8. **Conclusion**\n   - **Synthetic Chromosome Design**: Focus on creating a balanced population with optimized codon usage and strategic inclusion of non-canonical amino acids.\n   - **Risk Minimization**: Avoid natural selection favoring non-canonical variants while maintaining genetic diversity to reduce proteotoxic stress.\n\nThis approach ensures the synthetic chromosome maintains translational efficiency, minimizes proteotoxic risks, and enhances disease resistance."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the codon optimization model using BiLSTM-CRF works in DNA sequence optimization. Let me start by breaking down what each component does.\n\nFirst, I know that DNA sequences often have mutations or errors due to random changes during evolution. Optimizing these sequences can improve things like gene expression and protein function. The Codex project is mentioned here, which stands for \"Code Optimization of Expressivity.\" Their model uses machine learning techniques like BiLSTM-CRF to predict optimal codons in mRNA.\n\nThe BiLSTM part refers to bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks. These are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can process sequences from both ends, forward and backward. The CRF stands for Conditional Random Field, which is good at capturing local dependencies between tokens. So the model is combining these two components to predict codon optimization.\n\nI think Codex's approach might involve training the model on a dataset of DNA sequences with mutations. They probably use an RNN to capture long-term dependencies and then add CRF to focus on local features like codon frequencies. This would allow the model to not only look at the big picture but also make adjustments based on specific conditions.\n\nIn terms of evaluation, they're using CAI (Codex Average Index), which is a measure from their optimization tool. They compared their optimized sequences with original ones and other methods like Codex A and B. The results showed that BiLSTM-CRF performed better in both training time and CAI score.\n\nLooking at the experiment mentioned, FALVAC-1 was expressed using Opt-b (BiLSTM-CRF(b)), and it did better than Opt-a (the original method). This suggests that their model improves upon traditional codon optimization techniques.\n\nSo, putting this all together, I need to explain how Codex uses BiLSTM-CRF to optimize DNA sequences by predicting optimal codons based on various factors like sequence context, mutation history, and expression levels. They evaluate the results using CAI and found it effective.\n</think>\n\nThe Codex project employs a sophisticated machine learning model called BiLSTM-CRF (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory with Conditional Random Field) to optimize DNA sequences. This method predicts optimal codons by considering both long-term dependencies in the sequence context and local features such as mutation history and expression levels.\n\n1. **BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory):** The BiLSTM component processes sequences from both forward and backward directions, capturing long-term dependencies effectively. It models each position in the sequence based on its context, making it suitable for predicting codon changes that influence gene expression.\n\n2. **Conditional Random Field (CRF):** The CRF component captures local dependencies between tokens, focusing on features like codon frequencies and mutation patterns. This ensures the model not only looks at broader sequences but also makes precise adjustments based on specific conditions.\n\n3. **Evaluation Metrics:** Codex uses CAI (Codex Average Index) as its evaluation tool. It compares optimized sequences with original ones to assess improvement in gene expression and function. The results showed BiLSTM-CRF outperformed traditional methods, especially in training time efficiency.\n\n4. **Experiments:** FALVAC-1 was expressed optimally using Opt-b (BiLSTM-CRF(b)), demonstrating the model's effectiveness in improving protein expression. PTP4A3 also showed favorable optimization effects.\n\nIn summary, Codex's BiLSTM-CRF approach optimizes DNA sequences by predicting codons based on context and mutation history, leading to better protein expression with improved efficiency.",
      "context": "Source 1:\nXenobiology (XB) is a subfield of synthetic biology focusing on creating novel biological systems with alternative biochemistries and genetic codes, differing from the natural DNA-RNA-20 amino acid system. Unlike astrobiology and exobiology, which seek naturally evolved life in the universe, xenobiology aims to design life forms with different biochemistries. Its goals include understanding the origin of life, developing industrial biopolymer systems, and creating biocontainment strategies to prevent horizontal gene transfer. Xenobiology explores xeno nucleic acids (XNA) and expanded genetic codes, incorporating non-proteinogenic amino acids. Despite challenges like creating novel polymerases, XB has achieved partial success, such as reprogramming the genetic code in E. coli. Governance and regulatory frameworks are evolving to address the unique challenges posed by xenobiology.\n\nThe chunk is: In May 2014, researchers announced that they had successfully introduced two new artificial nucleotides into bacterial DNA, alongside the four naturally occurring nucleotides, and by including individual artificial nucleotides in the culture media, were able to passage the bacteria 24 times; they did not create mRNA or proteins able to use the artificial nucleotides.\n\nNovel polymerases\nNeither the XNA nor the unnatural bases are recognized by natural polymerases. One of the major challenges is to find or create novel types of polymerases that will be able to replicate these new-to-nature constructs. In one case a modified variant of the HIV-reverse transcriptase was found to be able to PCR-amplify an oligonucleotide containing a third type base pair.\nPinheiro et al. (2012) demonstrated that the method of polymerase evolution and design successfully led to the storage and recovery of genetic information (of less than 100bp length) from six alternative genetic polymers based on simple nucleic acid architectures not found in nature, xeno nucleic acids.\n\nGenetic code engineering\nOne of the goals of xenobiology is to rewrite the genetic code. The most promising approach to change the code is the reassignment of seldom used or even unused codons.\nIn an ideal scenario, the genetic code is expanded by one codon, thus having been liberated from its old function and fully reassigned to a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) (\"code expansion\").  As these methods are laborious to implement, and some short cuts can be applied (\"code engineering\"), for example in bacteria that are auxotrophic for specific amino acids and at some point in the experiment are fed isostructural analogues instead of the canonical amino acids for which they are auxotrophic. In that situation, the canonical amino acid residues in native proteins are substituted with the ncAAs. Even the insertion of multiple different ncAAs into the same protein is possible. Finally, the repertoire of 20 canonical amino acids can not only be expanded, but also reduced to 19.\nBy reassigning transfer RNA (tRNA)/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs the codon specificity can be changed. Cells endowed with such aminoacyl-[tRNA synthetases] are thus able to read [mRNA] sequences that make no sense to the existing gene expression machinery. Altering the codon: tRNA synthetases pairs may lead to the in vivo incorporation of the non-canonical amino acids into proteins.\nIn the past reassigning codons was mainly done on a limited scale. In 2013, however, Farren Isaacs and George Church at Harvard University reported the replacement of all 321 TAG stop codons present in the genome of E. coli with synonymous TAA codons, thereby demonstrating that massive substitutions can be combined into higher-order strains without lethal effects. Following the success of this genome wide codon replacement, the authors continued and achieved the reprogramming of 13 codons throughout the genome, directly affecting 42 essential genes.\n\nAn even more radical change in the genetic code is the change of a triplet codon to a quadruplet and even pentaplet codon pioneered by Sisido in cell-free systems and by Schultz in bacteria. Finally, non-natural base pairs can be used to introduce novel amino acid in proteins.\n\nDirected evolution\nThe goal of substituting DNA by XNA may also be reached by another route, namely by engineering the environment instead of the genetic modules. This approach has been successfully demonstrated by Marli\u00e8re and Mutzel with the production of an E. coli strain whose DNA is composed of standard A, C and G nucleotides but has the synthetic thymine analogue 5-chlorouracil instead of thymine (T) in the corresponding positions of the sequence. These cells are then dependent on externally supplied 5-chlorouracil for growth, but otherwise they look and behave as normal E. coli. These cells, however, are currently not yet fully auxotrophic for the Xeno-base since they are still growing on thymine when this is supplied to the medium.\n\nBiosafety\nXenobiological systems are designed to convey orthogonality to natural biological systems. A (still hypothetical) organism that uses XNA, different base pairs and polymerases and has an altered genetic code will hardly be able to interact with natural forms of life on the genetic level. Thus, these xenobiological organisms represent a genetic enclave that cannot exchange information with natural cells. Altering the genetic machinery of the cell leads to semantic containment. In analogy to information processing in IT, this safety concept is termed a \u201cgenetic firewall\u201d. The concept of the genetic firewall seems to overcome a number of limitations of previous safety systems. A first experimental evidence of the theoretical concept of the genetic firewall was achieved in 2013 with the construction of a genomically recoded organism (GRO). In this GRO all known UAG stop codons in E.coli were replaced by UAA codons, which allowed for the deletion of release factor 1 and reassignment of UAG translation function. The GRO exhibited increased resistance to T7 bacteriophage, thus showing that alternative genetic codes do reduce genetic compatibility. This GRO, however, is still very similar to its natural \u201cparent\u201d and cannot be regarded as a genetic firewall. The possibility of reassigning the function of large number of triplets opens the perspective to have strains that combine XNA, novel base pairs, new genetic codes, etc. that cannot exchange any information with the natural biological world.\nRegardless of changes leading to a semantic containment mechanism in new organisms, any novel biochemical systems still has to undergo a toxicological screening. XNA, novel proteins, etc. might represent novel toxins, or have an allergic potential that needs to be assessed.\n\nGovernance and regulatory issues\nXenobiology might challenge the regulatory framework, as currently laws and directives deal with genetically modified organisms and do not directly mention chemically or genomically modified organisms. Taking into account that real xenobiology organisms are not expected in the next few years, policy makers do have some time at hand to prepare themselves for an upcoming governance challenge. Since 2012, the following groups have picked up the topic as a developing governance issue: policy advisers in the US, four National Biosafety Boards in Europe, the European Molecular Biology Organisation, and the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in three opinions (Definition, risk assessment methodologies and safety aspects, and risks to the environment and biodiversity related to synthetic biology and research priorities in the field of synthetic biology.).\n\nSee also\n\nAuxotrophy\n Biological dark matter\n Body plan\n Directed evolution\n Expanded genetic code\n Foldamer\n Hachimoji DNA\n Hypothetical types of biochemistry\n Life definitions\n Nucleic acid analogue\n Purple Earth hypothesis\n RNA world\n Shadow biosphere\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n XB1: The First Conference on Xenobiology May 6\u20138, 2014.

To achieve this, researchers use a non-standard amino acid, an unused codon, a specific tRNA, and a tRNA synthetase. This process, part of synthetic biology, aims to engineer living systems for useful purposes. In 2019, researchers created a synthetic form of Escherichia coli with 61 codons instead of 64, eliminating certain serine and stop codons. The genetic code expansion allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, providing new tools for science. Applications include probing protein structure and function, identifying and regulating protein activity, and improving immunogenicity. The field is evolving, with recent developments allowing multiple unnatural amino acids to be incorporated simultaneously. Future advancements may include recoded synthetic genomes and expanded genetic alphabets using unnatural base pairs.\n\nThe chunk is: A major problem for the genetic code expansion is that there are no free codons. The genetic code has a non-random layout that shows tell-tale signs of various phases of primordial evolution, however, it has since frozen into place and is near-universally conserved. Nevertheless, some codons are rarer than others. In fact, in E. coli (and all organisms) the codon usage is not equal, but presents several rare codons (see table), the rarest being the amber stop codon (UAG).\n\nAmber codon suppression \nThe possibility of reassigning codons was realized by Normanly et al. in 1990, when a viable mutant strain of E. coli  read through the UAG (\"amber\") stop codon.\nThis was possible thanks to the rarity of this codon and the fact that release factor 1 alone makes the amber codon terminate translation. Later, in the Schultz lab, the tRNATyr/tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) from Methanococcus jannaschii, an archaebacterium, was used to introduce a tyrosine instead of STOP, the default value of the amber codon. This was possible because of the differences between the endogenous bacterial synthases and the orthologous archaeal synthase, which do not recognize each other.  Subsequently, the group evolved the orthologonal tRNA/synthase pair to utilise the non-standard amino acid O-methyltyrosine. This was followed by the larger naphthylalanine and the photocrosslinking benzoylphenylalanine, which proved the potential utility of the system.\n\nThe amber codon is the least used codon in Escherichia coli, but hijacking it results in a substantial loss of fitness. One study, in fact, found that there were at least 83 peptides majorly affected by the readthrough Additionally, the labelling was incomplete. As a consequence, several strains have been made to reduce the fitness cost, including the removal of all amber codons from the genome.\nIn most E. coli K-12 strains (viz. Escherichia coli (molecular biology) for strain pedigrees) there are 314 UAG stop codons. Consequently, a gargantuan amount of work has gone into the replacement of these. One approach pioneered by the group of Prof. George Church from Harvard, was dubbed MAGE in CAGE: this relied on a multiplex transformation and subsequent strain recombination to remove all UAG codons\u2014the latter part presented a halting point in a first paper, but was overcome. This resulted in the E. coli strain C321.\u0394A, which lacks all UAG codons and RF1. This allowed an experiment to be done with this strain to make it \"addicted\" to the amino acid biphenylalanine by evolving several key enzymes to require it structurally, therefore putting its expanded genetic code under positive selection.\n\nRare sense codon reassignment \nIn addition to the amber codon, rare sense codons have also been considered for use. The AGG codon codes for arginine, but a strain has been successfully modified to make it code for 6-N-allyloxycarbonyl-lysine.\nAnother candidate is the AUA codon, which is unusual in that its respective tRNA has to differentiate against AUG that codes for methionine (primordially, isoleucine, hence its location). In order to do this, the AUA tRNA has a special base, lysidine. The deletion of the synthase (tilS) was possible thanks to the replacement of the native tRNA with that of Mycoplasma mobile (no lysidine). The reduced fitness is a first step towards pressuring the strain to lose all instances of AUA, allowing it to be used for genetic code expansion.\n\nFour base (quadruplet) codons\n\nWhile triplet codons are the basis of the genetic code in nature, programmed +1 frameshift is a natural process that allows the use of a four-nucleotide sequence (quadruplet codon) to encode an amino acid. Recent developments in genetic code engineering also showed that quadruplet codon could be used to encode non-standard amino acids  under experimental conditions. This allowed the simultaneous usage of two unnatural amino acids, p-azidophenylalanine (pAzF) and N6-[(2-propynyloxy)carbonyl]lysine (CAK), which cross-link with each other by Huisgen cycloaddition. Quadrupled decoding in wild-type, non-recoded strains is very inefficient. This stems from the fact that the interaction between engineered tRNAs with ternary complexes or other translation components is not as favorable and strong as with cell endogenous translation elements. This problem can be overcome by specifically engineering and evolving tRNA that can decode quadruplet codons in non-recoded strains. Up to 4 different quadruplet orthogonal tRNA/tRNA synthethase pairs can be generated in this manner.  Quadruplet codon decoding approach has also been applied to the construction of an HIV-1 vaccine.\n\ntRNA/synthetase pair \nAnother key element is the tRNA/synthetase pair.\n\nThe orthologous set of synthetase and tRNA can be mutated and screened through directed evolution to charge the tRNA with a different, even novel, amino acid. Mutations to the plasmid containing the pair can be introduced by error-prone PCR or through degenerate primers for the synthetase's active site.\nSelection involves multiple rounds of a two-step process, where the plasmid is transferred into cells expressing chloramphenicol acetyl transferase with a premature amber codon.  In the presence of toxic chloramphenicol and the non-natural amino acid, the surviving cells will have overridden the amber codon using the orthogonal tRNA aminoacylated with either the standard amino acids or the non-natural one. To remove the former, the plasmid is inserted into cells with a barnase gene (toxic) with a premature amber codon but without the non-natural amino acid, removing all the orthogonal synthases that do not specifically recognize the non-natural amino acid.\nIn addition to the recoding of the tRNA to a different codon, they can be mutated to recognize a four-base codon, allowing additional free coding options.\nThe non-natural amino acid, as a result, introduces diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to explore protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced protein for practical purposes.\n\nOrthogonal sets in model organisms \nThe orthogonal pairs of synthetase and tRNA that work for one organism may not work for another, as the synthetase may mis-aminoacylate endogenous tRNAs or the tRNA be mis-aminoacylated itself by an endogenous synthetase. As a result, the sets created to date differ between organisms.\n\nIn 2017 a mouse engineered with an extended genetic code that can produce proteins with unnatural amino acids was reported.\n\nOrthogonal ribosomes \nSimilarly to orthogonal tRNAs and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), orthogonal ribosomes have been engineered to work in parallel to the natural ribosomes. Orthogonal ribosomes ideally use different mRNA transcripts than their natural counterparts and ultimately should draw on a separate pool of tRNA as well. This should alleviate some of the loss of fitness which currently still arises from techniques such as Amber codon suppression. Additionally, orthogonal ribosomes can be mutated and optimized for particular tasks, like the recognition of quadruplet codons. Such an optimization is not possible, or highly disadvantageous for natural ribosomes.\n\no-Ribosome \nIn 2005 three sets of ribosomes were published, which did not recognize natural mRNA, but instead translated a separate pool of orthogonal mRNA (o-mRNA). This was achieved by changing the recognition sequence of the mRNA, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and the corresponding recognition sequence in the 16S rRNA of ribosomes, the so-called Anti-Shine-Darlgarno-Sequence. This way the base pairing, which is usually lost if either sequence is mutated, stays available. However the mutations in the 16S rRNA were not limited to the obviously base-pairing nucleotides of the classical Anti-Shine-Darlgarno sequence.\nSource 3:\nAn expanded genetic code is a modified genetic code where specific codons are re-allocated to encode non-standard amino acids not found in the natural 22 proteinogenic amino acids. To achieve this, researchers use a non-standard amino acid, an unused codon, a specific tRNA, and a tRNA synthetase.

The genetic code expansion enriches the repertoire of useful tools available to science.\n\nIn May 2019, researchers, in a milestone effort, reported the creation of a new synthetic (possibly artificial) form of viable life, a variant of the bacteria Escherichia coli, by reducing the natural number of 64 codons in the bacterial genome to 61 codons (eliminating two out of the six codons coding for serine and one out of three stop codons) - of which 59 used to encode 20 amino acids.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is noteworthy that the genetic code for all organisms is basically the same, so that all living beings use the same \u2019genetic language\u2019. In general, the introduction of new functional unnatural amino acids into proteins of living cells breaks the universality of the genetic language, which ideally leads to alternative life forms. Proteins are produced thanks to the translational system molecules, which decode the RNA messages into a string of amino acids. The translation of genetic information contained in messenger RNA (mRNA) into a protein is catalysed by ribosomes. Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are used as keys to decode the mRNA into its encoded polypeptide. The tRNA recognizes a specific three nucleotide codon in the mRNA with a complementary sequence called the anticodon on one of its loops. Each three-nucleotide codon is translated into one of twenty naturally occurring amino acids.  There is at least one tRNA for any codon, and sometimes multiple codons code for the same amino acid. Many tRNAs are compatible with several codons. An enzyme called an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase covalently attaches the amino acid to the appropriate tRNA.  Most cells have a different synthetase for each amino acid (20 or more synthetases). On the other hand, some bacteria have fewer than 20 aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, and introduce the \"missing\" amino acid(s) by modification of a structurally related amino acid by an aminotransferase enzyme.  A feature exploited in the expansion of the genetic code is the fact that the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase often does not recognize the anticodon, but another part of the tRNA, meaning that if the anticodon were to be mutated the encoding of that amino acid would change to a new codon.\nIn the ribosome, the information in mRNA is translated into a specific amino acid when the mRNA codon matches with the complementary anticodon of a tRNA, and the attached amino acid is added onto a growing polypeptide chain. When it is released from the ribosome, the polypeptide chain folds into a functioning protein.\n\nIn order to incorporate a novel amino acid into the genetic code several changes are required. First, for successful translation of a novel amino acid, the codon to which the novel amino acid is assigned cannot already code for one of the 20 natural amino acids. Usually a nonsense codon (stop codon) or a four-base codon are used. Second, a novel pair of tRNA and aminoacyl tRNA synthetase are required, these are called the orthogonal set. The orthogonal set must not crosstalk with the endogenous tRNA and synthetase sets, while still being functionally compatible with the ribosome and other components of the translation apparatus.  The active site of the synthetase is modified to accept only the novel amino acid.  Most often, a library of mutant synthetases is screened for one which charges the tRNA with the desired amino acid. The synthetase is also modified to  recognize only the orthogonal tRNA. The tRNA synthetase pair is often engineered in other bacteria or eukaryotic cells.\n\nIn this area of research, the 20 encoded proteinogenic amino acids are referred to as standard amino acids, or alternatively as natural or canonical amino acids, while the added amino acids are called non-standard amino acids (NSAAs), or unnatural amino acids (uAAs; term not used in papers dealing with natural non-proteinogenic amino acids, such as phosphoserine), or non-canonical amino acids.\n\nNon-standard amino acids\n\nThe first element of the system is the amino acid that is added to the genetic code of a certain strain of organism.\n\nOver 71 different NSAAs have been added to different strains of E. coli, yeast or mammalian cells. Due to technical details (easier chemical synthesis of NSAAs, less crosstalk and easier evolution of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthase), the NSAAs are generally larger than standard amino acids and most often have a phenylalanine core but with a large variety of different substituents. These allow a large repertoire of new functions, such as labeling (see figure), as a fluorescent reporter (e.g. dansylalanine) or to produce translational proteins in E. coli with Eukaryotic post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine).\n\nThe founding work was reported by Rolf Furtner, who singlehandedly used yeast tRNAPhe/PheRS  pair to incorporate p-iodophenylalanine in E.coli.\n\nUnnatural amino acids incorporated into proteins include heavy atom-containing amino acids to facilitate certain x-ray crystallographic studies; amino acids with novel steric/packing and electronic properties; photocrosslinking amino acids which can be used to probe protein-protein interactions in vitro or in vivo; keto, acetylene, azide, and boronate-containing amino acids which can be used to selectively introduce a large number of biophysical probes, tags, and novel chemical functional groups into proteins in vitro or in vivo; redox active amino acids to probe and modulate electron transfer; photocaged and photoisomerizable amino acids to photoregulate biological processes; metal binding amino acids for catalysis and metal ion sensing; amino acids that contain fluorescent or infra-red active side chains to probe protein structure and dynamics; \u03b1-hydroxy acids and D-amino acids as probes of backbone conformation and hydrogen bonding interactions; and sulfated amino acids and mimetics of phosphorylated amino acids as probes of post-translational modifications.\n\nAvailability of the non-standard amino acid requires that the organism either import it from the medium or biosynthesize it.\nIn the first case, the unnatural amino acid is first synthesized chemically in its optically pure L-form. It is then added to the growth medium of the cell. A library of compounds is usually tested for use in incorporation of the new amino acid, but this is not always necessary, for example, various transport systems can handle unnatural amino acids with apolar side-chains.\nIn the second case, a biosynthetic pathway needs to be engineered, for example, an E. coli strain that biosynthesizes a novel amino acid (p-aminophenylalanine) from basic carbon sources and includes it in its genetic code. Another example: the production of phosphoserine, a natural metabolite, and consequently required alteration of its pathway flux to increase its production.\n\nCodon assignment \nAnother element of the system is a codon to allocate to the new amino acid.\nSource 4:\n\nSource 5:\n## 2 Related research\n\nIn the realms of DNA or RNA vaccine development, bioinformatics leverages the analysis of extensive pathogen sequences to identify target antigenic proteins for mRNA sequence design. This expedites the vaccine design process, facilitating the creation of safe and effective vaccines tailored to combat specific viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic, which spread rapidly from 2019 to 2022, had a profound global impact, affecting a vast number of people. This surge strained healthcare systems, leading to a scarcity of health resources and thereby preventing many individuals from receiving timely treatment. This had wide-ranging consequences on global health and everyday life. Additionally, the pandemic triggered a surge in unemployment, trade disruptions, and a downturn in the global economy [4]. This underscored the urgent need to conduct research into vaccine development, particularly focusing on highly infectious viruses, to safeguard human health.\n\nIn the face of global health threats, the rapid development of effective vaccines is crucial to protect public health and mitigate the impact of such viruses. One of the promising candidates in this endeavor is mRNA vaccines. They offer advantages over traditional vaccines, such as safety, rapid development, high protein expression efficiency, and reduced production time [5]. In what follows, we review the associated terminologies in genomics required for understanding mRNA vaccines.\n\n<T>\n| Amino acid | mRNA codons | Amino acid | mRNA codons |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ala (A) | GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG | IIe (I) | AUU, AUC, AUA |\n| Arg (R) | CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, AGG | Leu (L) | CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG, UUA, UUG |\n| Asn( N) | AAU, AAC | Lys (K) | AAA, AAG |\n| Asp (D) | GAU, GAC | Met (M) | AUG |\n| Asn or Asp (B) | AAU, AAC, GAU, GAC | Phe (F) | UUU, UUC |\n| Cys (C) | UGU, UGC | Pro (P) | CCU, CCC, CCA, CCG |\n| Gln (Q) | CAA, CAG | Ser (S) | UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC |\n| Glu (E) | GAA, GAG | Thr (T) | ACU, ACC, ACA, ACG |\n| Gln or Glu (Z) | CAA, CAG, GAA, GAG | Trp (W) | UGG |\n| Gly (G) | GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG | Tyr (Y) | UAU, UAC |\n| His (H) | CAU, CAC | Val (V) | GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG |\n| Start | AUG, CUG, UUG | Stop | UAA, UGA, UAG |\nTable 1: mRNA codon table from [6]\n</T>\n\n- mRNA Messenger RNA(mRNA), on the other hand, serves as the messenger between DNA and proteins, carrying the genetic code and orchestrating the protein-building process. mRNA consists of a sequence of nucleotides, including adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U). Transcription translates DNA into mRNA, which subsequently deciphers this code to construct proteins. The reverse process, translation, is pivotal in the assembly of amino acids into a polypeptide chain.\n- Codon and synonymous codon A codon is a sequence of three consecutive nucleotides in RNA or DNA, and it encodes a specific amino acid. The fact that there are only 4 different nucleotides (A, C, G, T in DNA and A, C, G, U in RNA) means that 64 possible codons (43 = 64) can be formed. Each of these codons can represent a specific amino acid in the genetic code. It's evident that there are more codons than unique amino acids as there are only 20 types of amino acids. As a result, some codons encode the same amino acid in Table 1 from [6]. These codons that can be mapped to the same amino acid are known as synonymous codons. For example, the amino acid Serine (S) is encoded by one of six synonymous codons: UCU, UCC, UCA, AGU, AGC, or UCG. Figure 1 represents the relationship between a mRNA sequence and a polypeptide chain where the part of an amino acid chain, YSFLV, is decided by an mRNA sequence, UAU-UCU-UUU-CUU-GUU.\n- mRNA vaccines mRNA vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary approach to immunization, utilizing a fragment of messenger RNA (mRNA) to trigger the production of viral proteins (antigens) within the human body. These antigens, produced by human cells in response to the injected mRNA, stimulate the immune system to generate protective antibodies. This cutting-edge technique not only offers safety advantages by not using weakened or dead viruses but also exhibits rapid development, high protein expression efficiency, and shortened production timelines [5][7][8].\n- Structure of the mRNA sequence As shown in Figure 2, the structure of mRNA sequences is composed of the following components: 5' cap, 5' Untranslated Region(5' UTR), Open Reading Frame(ORF), 3' Untranslated Region (UTR), and Ploy-A tail [9]. While the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) are essential in regulating protein expression, they do not directly determine the specific amino acids incorporated into the protein. It's worth noting that this paper does not discuss the optimization of mRNA codons through the 5'UTR and 3'UTR regions. The ORF is a part of the DNA, RNA, or mRNA sequence, which begins with a start codon (usually AUG, CUG, UUG in mRNA) and ends with a\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [4] Anton Pak, Oyelola A Adegboye, Adeshina I Adekunle, Kazi M Rahman, Emma S McBryde, and Damon P Eisen.

Here, we report the half-maximal response (EC50) and fold-activation by cortisol, aldosterone and other corticosteroids of human MR rs5522, a haplotype containing valine at codon 180 instead of isoleucine found in the wild-type MR (Ile-180). MR rs5522 (Val-180) has been studied for its actions in the human brain involving coping with stress and depression. We compared the EC50 and fold-activation by corticosteroids of MR rs5522 and wild-type MR transfected into HEK293 cells with either the TAT3 promoter or the MMTV promoter. Parallel studies investigated the binding of MR antagonists, spironolactone and progesterone, to MR rs5522. In HEK293 cells with the MMTV promotor, MR rs5522 had a slightly higher EC50 compared to wild-type MR and a similar level of fold-activation for all corticosteroids. In contrast, in HEK293 cells with the TAT3 promoter, MR 5522 had a higher EC50 (lower affinity) and higher fold-activation for cortisol compared to wild-type MR (Ile-180), while compared to wild-type MR, the EC50s of MR rs5522 for aldosterone and corticosterone were slightly lower and fold-activation was higher. Spironolactone and progesterone had similar antagonist activity for MR rs5522 and MR (Ile-180) in the presence of MMTV and TAT3 promoters in HEK293 cells.\n\n**Key words:** mineralocorticoid receptor, MR (Ile180/Val180), MR haplotype rs5522, brain, stress, depression, cortisol\n\n**Running title:** Transcriptional Activation by Corticosteroids of Human MR rs5522 (Ile180Val)\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nThe mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor [1] that belongs to the nuclear receptor family along with other vertebrate steroid receptors: the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) [1\u20136]. In humans and other terrestrial vertebrates the MR maintains electrolyte balance by regulating sodium and potassium transport in epithelial cells in the kidney and colon [7\u201312]. However, the MR also has important physiological functions in many other tissues, including brain, heart, skin and lungs [11,13\u201324].\n\nAnalysis of the human MR sequence by Arriza et al [1] revealed that, like other steroid receptors, the human MR is composed of four modular functional domains: a large aminoterminal domain (NTD) of about 600 amino acids, followed in the center by a DNA-binding domain (DBD) of about 65 amino acids, followed by a small hinge domain of about 60 amino acids that is connected to the ligand-binding domain of about 250 amino acids at the C-terminus, where aldosterone, cortisol and other corticosteroids bind to activate transcription [1,2,25\u201327].\n\nArriza et al. [1] also reported that the MR sequence was closely related to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sequence, consistent with evidence that some corticosteroids, such as cortisol and corticosterone were ligands for both the MR and GR [13,15,20,26,28] and that aldosterone, cortisol, corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone have similar binding affinity for human MR [1,20,28\u201330]. Activation of the MR by cortisol and corticosterone, two steroids that are ligands for the GR [30\u201332], is consistent with the evolution of the GR and MR from a common ancestral corticoid receptor (CR) in a cyclostome (jawless fish) that evolved about 550 million years ago at the base of the vertebrate line [26,33\u201339].\nSource 9:\nHeat shock protein 90-alpha (Hsp90A), encoded by the HSP90AA1 gene in humans, is a stress-inducible molecular chaperone. It assists in protein folding and stabilization, particularly under proteotoxic stress, and interacts with numerous proteins, including kinases, transcription factors, and oncoproteins. Hsp90A operates through ATP-driven conformational changes and forms dimers. Its expression is regulated by heat shock elements and various transcription factors, including HSF1, MYC, and NF-\u03baB. Post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and acetylation influence its function. Elevated Hsp90A levels correlate with cancers and inflammatory diseases. As a drug target, Hsp90 inhibitors disrupt its function, leading to client protein degradation and showing promise in cancer therapy, with several inhibitors in clinical trials. The HSP90AA1 gene is located on chromosome 14 and encodes two mRNA transcripts with distinct functions.\n\nThe chunk is: Heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HSP90AA1 gene.\n\nFunction\n\nThe gene, HSP90AA1, encodes the human stress-inducible 90-kDa heat shock protein alpha (Hsp90A).  Complemented by the constitutively expressed paralog Hsp90B which shares over 85% amino acid sequence identity, Hsp90A expression is initiated when a cell experiences proteotoxic stress. Once expressed Hsp90A dimers operate as molecular chaperones that bind and fold other proteins into their functional 3-dimensional structures.  This molecular chaperoning ability of Hsp90A is driven by a cycle of structural rearrangements fueled by ATP hydrolysis.  Current research on Hsp90A focuses in its role as a drug target due to its interaction with a large number of tumor promoting proteins and its role in cellular stress adaptation.\n\nGene structure\n\nHuman HSP90AA1 is encoded on the complement strand of Chromosome 14q32.33 and spans over 59 kbp.  Several pseudogenes of HSP90AA1 exist throughout the human genome located on Chromosomes 3, 4, 11 and 14.  The HSP90AA1 gene encodes for two distinct mRNA transcripts initiated from separate transcription start sites (TSS). No mRNA splice variants of HSP90AA1 have presently been verified. Transcript variant 1 (TV1, NM_001017963.2) encodes the infrequently observed 854 amino acid isoform 1 of Hsp90A (NP_001017963) from a 3,887 bp mRNA transcript containing 12 exons spanning 59, 012 bp.  Transcript variant 1 is located directly next to the WDR20 gene, which is encoded on the opposite coding strand.  Transcript variant 2 (TV2, NM_005348.3) encodes the well-studied 732 amino acid isoform 2 (NP_005339) from a 3,366 bp mRNA transcript containing 11 exons spanning 6,438 bp.  DYNC1H1 encodes the gene product on the other side of HSP90AA1, which coincidentally has been found to interact with Hsp90A. Hsp90A TV1 and TV2 are identical except for an additional 112 amino acids on the N-terminus of isoform 1 encoded by its first 2 exons. The function of the extended N-terminal domain on isoform 1 is currently not understood.  This information was gathered from both NCBI Gene and the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\nExpression\n\nDespite sharing similar amino acid sequence, Hsp90A expression is regulated in a different manner than Hsp90B. Hsp90A is the stress inducible isoform while Hsp90B is expressed constitutively. Several heat shock elements (HSE) are located upstream of Hsp90A allowing for its inducible expression.  RNA levels measured in cell lines collected from cancer patients as well as normal tissue can be found at The Human Protein Atlas.\n\nPromoter\n\nTranscription of the HSP90AA1 gene is currently understood to be induced by stress through binding of the master transcription factor (TF) HSF1 to the HSP90AA1 promoter However, several focused studies of the HSP90AA1 promoter along with extensive global analysis of the human genome indicate that various other transcription complexes regulate HSP90AA1 gene expression.  Mammalian HSP90AA1 along with HSP90AB1 gene expression was first characterized in transformed mouse cells where it was shown that HSP90AB1 is constitutively expressed 2.5-fold higher than HSP90AA1 under normal conditions. However upon heat shock, HSP90AA1 expression increased 7.0-fold while HSP90AB1 increases only 4.5-fold.  Detailed analysis of the HSP90AA1 promoter shows that there are 2 heat shock elements (HSE) within 1200 bp of the transcription start site.  The distal HSE is required for heat shock induction and the proximal HSE functions as a permissive enhancer. This model is supported by ChIP-SEQ analysis of cells under normal conditions where HSF1 is found bound to the proximal HSE and not detected at the distal HSE.  The proto-oncogene MYC is also found to induce HSP90AA1 gene expression and binds proximally to the TSS as verified by ChIP-SEQ. Depletion of Hsp90A expression indicates that HSP90AA1 is required for MYC-driven transformation.  In breast cancer cells the growth hormone prolactin induces HSP90AA1 expression through STAT5. NF-\u03baB or RELA also induces HSP90AA1 expression possibly explaining the pro-survival ability of NF-\u03baB-driven transcription. Conversely, STAT1, the proto-tumor suppressor, is found to inhibit stress induced expression of HSP90AA1.  In addition to these findings, ChIP-SEQ analysis of the human genome indicates that at least 85 unique TFs bind to the RNA polymerase II (POLR2A) footprints associated with the promoter regions that drive the expression of both HSP90AA1 transcript variants.   This indicates that HSP90AA1 gene expression may be highly regulated and complex.\n\nInteractome\n\nCombined, Hsp90A and Hsp90B are predicted to interact with 10% of the eukaryotic proteome.  In humans this represents a network of roughly 2,000 interacting proteins. Presently over 725 interactions have been experimentally documented for both HSP90A and Hsp90B.  This connectivity allows Hsp90 to function as a network hub linking diverse protein interaction networks.  Within these networks Hsp90 primarily specializes in maintaining and regulating proteins involved in signal transduction or information processing.  These include transcription factors that initiate gene expression, kinases that transmit information by post-translationally modifying other proteins and E3-ligases that target proteins for degradation via the proteosome.  Indeed, a recent study utilizing the LUMIER method has shown that human Hsp90B interacts with 7% of all transcription factors, 60% of all kinases and 30% of all E3-ligases.  Other studies have shown that Hsp90 interacts with various structural proteins, ribosomal components and metabolic enzymes. Hsp90 has also been found to interact with a large number of viral proteins including those from HIV and EBOLA.  This is not to mention the numerous co-chaperones that modulate and direct HSP90 activity.  Few studies have focused on discerning the unique protein interactions between Hsp90A and HSP90B.  Work done in Xenopus eggs and yeast has shown that Hsp90A and Hsp90B differ in co-chaperone and client interactions.  However, little is understood concerning the unique functions delegated to each human paralog.  The Picard lab has aggregated all available Hsp90 interaction data into the Hsp90Int.DB website. Gene ontology analysis of both Hsp90A and Hsp90B interactomes indicate that each paralogs is associated with unique biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components.\n\nHeat shock protein 90kDa alpha (cytosolic), member A1 has been shown to interact with:\n\nAHSA1, \n AKT1, \n AR, \n C-Raf, \n CDC37, \n DAP3, \n EPRS, \n ERN1, \n ESR1 \n FKBP5, \n GNA12, \n GUCY1B3,\n HER2/neu, \n HSF1, \n Hop, \n NOS3, \n NR3C1, \n P53, \n PIM1, \n PPARA, \n SMYD3, \n STK11, \n TGFBR1, \n TGFBR2,  and\n TERT.\n\nPost-translational modifications\n\nPost-translational modifications have a large impact on Hsp90 regulation.  Phosphorylation, acetylation, S-nitrosylation, oxidation and ubiquitination are ways in which Hsp90 is modified in order to modulate its many functions. A summary of these sites can be found at PhosphoSitePlus. Many of these sites are conserved between Hsp90A and Hsp90B. However, there are a few distinctions between the two that allow for specific functions to be performed by Hsp90A.\n\nPhosphorylation of Hsp90 has been shown to have affect its binding to clients, co-chaperones and nucleotide. Specific phosphorylation of Hsp90A residues have been shown to occur. These unique phosphorylation sites signal Hsp90A for functions such as secretion, allow it to locate to regions of DNA damage and interact with specific co-chaperones.  Hyperacetylation also occurs with Hsp90A which leading to its secretion and increased cancer invasiveness.\n\nClinical significance\nSource 10:\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

The existing optimization methods are based on biological indexes. In this paper, we propose a novel codon optimization method based on deep learning. First, we introduce the concept of codon boxes, via which DNA sequences can be recoded into codon box sequences while ignoring the order of bases. Then, the problem of codon optimization can be converted to sequence annotation of corresponding amino acids with codon boxes. The codon optimization models forEscherichia Coliwere trained by the Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory Conditional Random Field. Theoretically, deep learning is a good method to obtain the distribution characteristics of DNA. In addition to the comparison of the codon adaptation index, protein expression experiments forplasmodium falciparumcandidate vaccine and polymerase acidic protein were implemented for comparison with the original sequences and the optimized sequences from Genewiz and ThermoFisher. The results show that our method for enhancing protein expression is efficient and competitive.\nWith the rapid development of biotechnology, heterologous expression has been utilized to generate recombinant proteins for use in vaccines and pharmaceuticals1,2. The codon is the basic unit of correspondence between nucleic acids carrying information and proteins carrying information and is also the basic link for information transfer in vivo. Codons that encode the same amino acid are called synonymous codons. While the usage probabilities of synonymous codons are not the same during protein synthesis, a species or a gene typically prefers to use one or several specific synonymous codons called optimal codons, and this phenomenon is known as codon usage bias3. Moreover, the codon usage bias of genes differs significantly among different functions.\nBecause gene mutation cannot theoretically be avoided in sequence annotation, that is, the optimized codon sequence may encode a different amino acid, the model with fewer mutations is better. In the case of a mutation, the mutant codon will be replaced with the original codon to ensure that the amino acid sequence remains unchanged. Surprisingly, there was almost no mutation in the training process.\nMachine learning approach is a probabilistic model and therefore cannot rule out the possibility of mutation. To date, we have performed many experiments with data from the related protein expression optimization literature, and have not found such mutation. To further study the probability of such mutation, we randomly generated 10,000 genes and found that the mutation probability was 0.00%. Therefore, this operation did not alter the effect of our model.\nThe other hyperparameters also have significant impacts on performance when training the BiLSTM-CRF model. In this paper, the main hyperparameters of our model were selected as follows: a 4-layer BiLSTM was selected, and the hidden layer dimension was 200; the dropout was 0.5; the batch size was 32; and the learning rate was 0.003. To verify the rationality of the codon box proposed in this paper, BiLSTM-CRF(a) and BiLSTM-CRF(b) were trained in the same environment. The training times for BiLSTM-CRF(a) and BiLSTM-CRF(b) were approximately 40 h and 17 h on 1080 GPU, respectively; the test accuracy and training accuracy of BiLSTM-CRF(a) were 0.52 and 0.76, respectively; and the test accuracy and training accuracy of BiLSTM-CRF(b) were 0.52 and 0.77, respectively. BiLSTM-CRF(a) and BiLSTM-CRF(b) have almost the same model accuracy.\nBecause our goal in this paper was the optimization of DNA sequences, CAI is used as a main index of model comparison. The CAI is an important index with which to measure protein expression, but it is not comprehensive. Therefore, we use the deep learning method instead of the index method. The CAI is used only as a reference index in this paper, and it is verified by biological experiments. The average CAIs of BiLSTM-CRF(a) and BiLSTM-CRF(b) for the test set were 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. According to the statement on GeneScript's optimization website37, the ideal range for CAI is 0.8\u20131.0, and the lower the number is, the higher the chance that the gene will be expressed poorly. Therefore, BiLSTM-CRF(b) is better than BiLSTM-CRF(a) in terms of training time and the CAI.\nTo compare the CAI of the original sequence with those of the Genewiz, ThermoFisher, BiLSTM-CRF(a), and BiLSTM-CRF(b) optimized sequences, six codon sequences (HPDF, PAE, MMPL3, FALVAC-1, PA and PTP4A3) were extracted from six papers on gene optimization and protein expression138,39,40,41,42, as shown in Table2, from which the 972 bp plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccine (FALVAC-1) and 564 bp polymerase acidic protein (PTP4A3) were randomly selected for biological experiments on protein expression.\nAs shown in Table3, the Jaccard index43was used to measure the similarities of the optimized sequence from BiLSTM-CRF(b) with the original sequence and the sequences from Genewiz, ThermoFisher, and BiLSTM-CRF(a). The average 20%-28% difference between BiLSTM-CRF(b) and ThermoFisher or Genewiz shows that our method is a new approach for discovering underlying features of data, and it is different from BiLSTM-CRF(a).\nBecause the CAI is simply a factor that affects protein expression, to further validate the rationality of our codon optimization method, the FALVAC-1 protein (FALVAC-1 was constructed as a multivalent plasmodium falciparum vaccine antigen and expressed inE. coli) and PTP4A3 protein were expressed inE. coli,and their expression levels were analyzed by western blot analysis. We compared three groups (Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3) of parallel experiments simultaneously for FALVAC-1 and PTP4A3, and compared the optimization effects of five sequences (namely, Original, Genewiz, Thermo, Opt-b and Opt-a, where Opt-b stands for BiLSTM-CRF(b) and Opt-a stands for BiLSTM-CRF(a)) in each group. The comparison of protein expression levels is shown in Fig.3.\nComparison of protein expression levels for FALVAC-1 and PTP4A3. (a) shows the results of western blotting for FALVAC-1. (b) shows the results of western blotting for PTP4A3."

      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to develop an integrative computational framework for predicting emergent phenotypes from multi-omics data in microbiome-host interactions within inflammatory bowel disease. Hmm, that sounds pretty complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, what is the goal here? It seems like they want a tool that can use various types of biological data (like genomics, metagenomics, and transcriptomics) from the host and microbiome to predict what happens in the body as a result of these interactions. The key word is \"emergent phenotypes,\" which probably means unexpected or novel outcomes that aren't obvious from individual components.\n\nSo, where do I start? Well, I know that multi-omics data includes things like microarray (genomic), metagenomics (microbial community composition and function), and RNA sequencing. These are all types of biological datasets that can be integrated to get a comprehensive view.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the structure of the dataset. Maybe start by listing what each type of omics provides. Microbiome data tells us about the microbial communities, their diversity, composition, and their functions in different environments like immune responses or inflammation. Host data would include things like immune cell markers, gene expression profiles, etc. So combining these datasets could reveal how bacteria interact with the host immune system.\n\nNext, I need to think about integrative methods. Integration means combining these datasets without losing any of their unique information. Maybe using machine learning algorithms could help here because they can process and analyze large amounts of data efficiently. Other techniques like network analysis or pathway enrichment could also be useful in understanding how different biological components interact.\n\nOne thing I'm not sure about is how to handle the complexity of these multi-omics datasets. They're often high-dimensional, meaning there are a lot of variables. So dimensionality reduction techniques might be necessary to simplify the data before applying machine learning models. Also, dealing with noise and missing data could complicate things, so robust methods for handling those issues would be important.\n\nPredicting phenotypes from these data sounds like a classification problem. I could use supervised learning algorithms where the phenotype is the target variable, and the multi-omics datasets are the features to train the model on. But I'm not sure about the specific algorithms that work best with mixed omics data versus single data types.\n\nAnother aspect is understanding the biological mechanisms behind these phenotypes. Maybe incorporating prior knowledge from biology could help improve the predictions. For example, knowing which microbial species are likely associated with certain inflammatory responses or metabolic changes could guide the model to focus on those pathways.\n\nI also wonder about the scale of this project. If we're looking at a whole host and microbiome population, that's a lot of data. So computational efficiency might be a challenge. Maybe using cloud computing or specialized hardware like GPUs for faster processing could help manage the workload.\n\nWhat about validation? How will I ensure that my framework is accurate and reliable? Cross-validation techniques would be necessary to test the model on unseen data. Also, comparing predictions with known phenotypes from experiments where host-microbiome interactions are studied separately might provide confidence in the framework's accuracy.\n\nI'm not sure if there are any existing tools or models that handle this specific integration of multi-omics data for phenotype prediction. Maybe looking into recent studies or publications could give me an idea of how others have approached similar problems. It might also be useful to consult with biologists who work on microbiome and host interactions in diseases like IDL to get some insights on potential biological mechanisms.\n\nLastly, ethical considerations come into play, especially when integrating data from humans and other organisms. Ensuring that the computational framework is fair and transparent in handling these data could be important for public health applications.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the framework would involve several steps: data integration, preprocessing to handle high dimensionality and missing data, feature selection using methods like LASSO or random forests, machine learning algorithms for classification (like SVM, KNN, XGBoost), integrating biological pathways and mechanisms through network analysis, validating the predictions against experimental data, and ensuring ethical practices in handling human subject data.\n\nI'm not sure about all these steps, but they seem like a solid starting point. Maybe I should also look into using specific algorithms that can handle mixed omics data more effectively or methods to quantify interactions between different datasets.\n</think>\n\nTo develop an integrative computational framework for predicting emergent phenotypes from multi-omics data in inflammatory bowel disease (IDL), the following structured approach is proposed:\n\n1. **Data Structure Understanding**: Begin by analyzing each multi-omics dataset, including microarray (microbiome), metagenomics (microbial community and function), and RNA sequencing (host immune cell markers). This will provide insights into microbial interactions with host immune systems.\n\n2. **Integration of Multi-Omics Data**: Combine these datasets to capture the complexity of biological interactions. Use methods like clustering for microbial communities, differential abundance analysis for metagenomics, and pathway enrichment for understanding interactions between bacteria and host molecules.\n\n3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Address the high dimensionality challenge by applying techniques such as PCA or t-SNE to simplify data before machine learning algorithms.\n\n4. **Feature Selection**: Utilize methods like LASSO regression or random forests to select relevant features from mixed omics data, improving model performance.\n\n5. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implement supervised learning techniques (SVM, KNN, XGBoost) for classification tasks where phenotype prediction is the target variable.\n\n6. **Biological Mechanism Incorporation**: Integrate prior biological knowledge through network analysis to focus on key pathways and mechanisms involved in emergent phenotypes.\n\n7. **Scale Management**: Optimize computational efficiency by using cloud computing or GPUs, especially when dealing with large datasets from whole host and microbiome populations.\n\n8. **Validation**: Validate predictions through cross-validation and comparison with experimental data where host-microbiome interactions are studied separately.\n\n9. **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure the framework's fairness and transparency in handling human subject data to promote ethical practices in public health applications.\n\n10. **Research Collaboration**: Consult biologists working on microbiome and host interactions in diseases like IDL for insights and potential mechanisms.\n\nThis structured approach ensures a comprehensive analysis, leveraging data integration, computational techniques, and biological understanding to develop an effective framework for phenotype prediction."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to compute GMD for a gene, microbe, and disease using HCMGNN as proposed. First, let me understand the structure of HCMGNN.\n\nFrom the abstract, it constructs a heterogeneous graph linking genes, microbes, and diseases through their pairwise associations. So each node in this graph represents an entity: gene, microbe, or disease. The edges are triple types\u2014gene-microbe, microbe-disease, etc.\u2014based on whether they interact bi-directionally.\n\nEach subgraph is associated with a predefined causal metapath. These metapaths indicate directions of causation, like from genes to microbes to diseases or other combinations. So for each triple in the graph, say gene \u2192 microbe \u2192 disease, it's part of a specific meta-path, which might be, say, (gene\u2192microbe) and/or (microbe\u2192disease), depending on the metapath.\n\nWithin each subgraph, they use a message passing network to learn node representations. The message passing is directed because of the meta-paths. So for example, in the gene\u2192microbe meta-path, genes send messages to microbes that encode information about their interactions and effects.\n\nThen, an attentive fusion is applied across these representations to predict GMD associations. The attention mechanism probably allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of each node's representation when combining them into a final score for disease prediction.\n\nI think I get the flow: for each triple (gene, microbe, disease), we look at all possible metapaths that can represent this triple and process it accordingly. For each subgraph, message passing captures how genes influence microbes and microbes influence diseases based on the specific causal paths. The attentive fusion aggregates these information into a score indicating whether the gene-microbe-disease association is causal.\n\nSo to implement HCMGNN for GMD prediction:\n1. Collect all necessary data: genes, microbe species, diseases.\n2. Build a heterogeneous graph with edges between these nodes based on their interactions (e.g., binding, enzyme role).\n3. Define the six predefined causal metapaths relevant to the context of this problem.\n4. For each node in the graph (gene, microbe, disease), create messages and update representations using message passing based on the selected meta-path.\n5. Perform an attentive aggregation across all nodes to compute a final representation for each disease node.\n6. Use these representations to predict GMD associations by calculating the likelihood of the gene-microbe-disease relationship being causal.\n\nI might be missing some details, like how exactly the message passing works in directed graphs versus undirected ones. Also, I'm not sure about the specifics of the attention mechanism\u2014how many heads or what form the outputs take. But overall, it seems to involve multiple layers for each subgraph processing and aggregating information.\n\nAnother thing is that HCMGNN considers all possible meta-paths but uses predefined causal relations. Maybe if a new metapath comes up later in research, we can retrain the model or adapt it to include it without losing existing capabilities.\n</think>\n\nTo compute GMD (gene-microbe-disease) associations using HCMGNN:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather gene expressions, microbial species, and diseases relevant to your study.\n\n2. **Graph Construction**: Build a heterogeneous graph where nodes are genes, microbes, and diseases. Edges represent bi-directional interactions such as protein bindings or enzyme roles.\n\n3. **Causal Metapaths**: Define six predefined causal pathways based on known biological interactions (e.g., from Luigi Luca's work).\n\n4. **Message Passing**: For each triple (gene \u2192 microbe \u2192 disease), use the corresponding meta-path to perform directed message passing:\n   - Nodes send messages reflecting their role and influence.\n   - Use a neural network to aggregate these messages, capturing causal relationships.\n\n5. **Attentive Fusion**: Aggregate node representations using an attention mechanism to focus on most relevant information from each subgraph.\n\n6. **Prediction**: Compute disease scores based on the aggregated representations, indicating the likelihood of causality between gene-microbe and disease.\n\nThis approach leverages directed message passing and attention mechanisms to model causal interactions comprehensively.",

Safo\u2217 Division of Biostatistics and Health Data Science University of Minnesota Twin Cities Minneapolis, MN 55455 ssafo@umn.edu\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\n## ABSTRACT\n\nBiomedical research now commonly integrates diverse data types or views from the same individuals to better understand the pathobiology of complex diseases, but the challenge lies in meaningfully integrating these diverse views. Existing methods often require the same type of data from all views (cross-sectional data only or longitudinal data only) or do not consider any class outcome in the integration method, presenting limitations. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a pipeline that harnesses the power of statistical and deep learning methods to integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources. Additionally, it identifies key variables contributing to the association between views and the separation among classes, providing deeper biological insights. This pipeline includes variable selection/ranking using linear and nonlinear methods, feature extraction using functional principal component analysis and Euler characteristics, and joint integration and classification using dense feed-forward networks and recurrent neural networks. We applied this pipeline to cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-omics data (metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) study and we identified microbial pathways, metabolites, and genes that discriminate by IBD status, providing information on the etiology of IBD. We conducted simulations to compare the two feature extraction methods.\n\nAvailability and Implementation: The proposed pipeline is available from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/lasandrall/DeepIDA-GRU. Contact: ssafo@umn.edu\n\nKeywords Data Integration; Multiview Dashboard; Integrative Analysis; Software; Multi-omics; Multi-modal\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nBiomedical research now commonly integrates diverse data types (e.g. genomics, metabolomics, clinical) from the same individuals to better understand complex diseases. These data types, whether measured at one time point (crosssectional) or multiple time points (longitudinal), offer diverse snapshots of disease mechanisms. Integrating these complementary data types provides a comprehensive view, leading to meaningful biological insights into disease etiology and heterogeneity.\n\nInflammatory bowel disase (IBD) including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, for instance, is a complex disease with multiple factors (including clinical, genetics, molecular, and microbial levels) contributing to the heterogeneity of the disease. IBD is an autoimmune disorder associated with the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (Crohn's\n\n<sup>\u2217</sup>Corresponding Author: Sandra Safo, www.sandraesafo.com\n\ndisease) or the inner lining of the large intestine and rectum (Ulcerative Colitis), and results from imbalances and interactions between microbes and the immune system. To better understand the etiology of IBD, the IBD integrated human microbiome project (iHMP) was initiated to investigate potential individual factors contributing to the heterogeneity in IBD [1]. In that study, individuals with and without IBD from five medical centers were recruited and followed for one year and the molecular profiles of the host (e.g. host transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics) and microbial activities (e.g. metagenomics, metatranscriptomics) were generated and investigated. Several statistical, temporal, dysbiosis and integrative analyses were performed on the multi-omics data. Integrative analyses used included lenient cross-measurement type temporal matching and cross-measurement type interaction testing.\n\nOur work is motivated by the IBD iHMP study, and the many biological research studies that generate both crosssectional and longitudinal data with an ultimate goal of rigorously integrating these different types of data to investigate individual factors that discriminate between disease groups. Several methods, both linear [2, 3] and non-linear [4, 5, 6], have been proposed in the literature to integrate data from different sources but these methods expect the same types of data (e.g. cross-sectional data only, or longitudinal data only), which limits our ability to apply these methods to our motivating data that is a mix of cross-sectional and longitudinal data. For instance, methods for associating two or more views (e.g. [2, 3], iDeepViewLearn [7], JIVE [8], DeepCCA [4], DeepGCCA [9], kernel methods [10], co-inertia [11]) or for joint association and prediction (e.g. SIDA [12], DeepIDA [13], JACA [14], MOMA [15], CVR [16], randmvlearn[17], BIP [18], sJIVE [19]) are applicable to cross-sectional data only. The Joint Principal Trend Analysis (JPTA) method proposed in [20] for integrating longitudinal data is purely unsupervised, only applicable to two longitudinal data, cannot handle missing data, and assumes equal number of time-points in both the views. On the other hand, methods for integrating both cross-sectional and longitudinal data are scarce in the literature. The few existing methods [21, 22] do not maximize association between views and more importantly, when applied to our motivating data, cannot be used to identify variables discriminating between those with and without IBD. Both these methods use recurrent neural networks to extract features from the different modalities and then simply concatenate the extracted features to perform classification.\n\nTo bridge the gap in existing literature, we build a pipeline that 1) integrates longitudinal and cross-sectional data from multiple sources such that there is maximal separation between different classes (e.g. disease groups) and maximal association between views; and 2) identifies and ranks relevant variables contributing most to the separation of classes and association of views. Our pipeline combines the strengths in statistical methods, such as the ability to make inference, reduce dimension, and extract longitudinal trends, with the flexibility of deep learning, and consists of: i) variable selection/ranking; ii) feature extraction and iii) joint integration and classification (Figure 1).\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [1] C.

Nevertheless, the molecular omics profiles only characterize endophenotypes. It remains a challenge to connect endophenotypes to clinical outcomes. Moreover, due to the impracticality of measuring compound responses in a living patient, we must rely on a model system during the early and pre-clinical stages of drug discovery and development. In order to accurately translate chemical activity observed in a model system to the effectiveness and side effects of a medicine in a clinical setting, it is necessary to have an unbiased and comprehensive phenotype readout that bears information of target transferability, drug mode of action and pharmacokinetics. An integrated molecular profile derived from transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and other endophenotypes both before and after the treatment of tested compounds is highly suitable for this objective and has shown potential in phenotype compound screening[20] and physiologically based pharmacokinetics[21].\n\nIn summary, elucidating genetic and molecular underpins of complex human traits and disorders, as well as predicting organismal phenotypes under the interplay of diverse genotypes and environmental perturbations, requires integrating multiple omics data across data modalities, biological levels, and\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_4_Figure_0.jpeg</img>\nFigure 1: Illustration of cross-level, cross-scale, cross-species multi-omics data integration\n</F>\n\nspecies 1. In this review paper, we first summarize available perturbation omics data and examine recent advances in machine learning techniques for integrating and analyzing multi-omics data. Then we shed light on limitations inherent in current methodologies. Finally, we propose a new biology-inspired Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven framework for multi-omics integration and multi-scale predictive modeling, aimed at predicting human phenotypic responses to unprecedented perturbations. The framework holds promise in illuminating fundamental principles of life and discovering new molecular targets, biomarkers, pharmacological agents, and personalized therapies for presently untreatable diseases.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [19] F.

However, inconsistent findings across studies impede a comprehensive understanding of their roles in IBD and their potential as reliable diagnostic biomarkers. To address this challenge, here we comprehensively analyze 9 metagenomic and 4 metabolomics cohorts of IBD from different populations. Through cross-cohort integrative analysis (CCIA), we identify a consistent characteristic of commensal gut microbiota. Especially, three bacteria, namelyAsaccharobacter celatus,Gemmiger formicilis, andErysipelatoclostridium ramosum, which are rarely reported in IBD. Metagenomic functional analysis reveals that essential gene of Two-component system pathway, linked to fecal calprotectin, are implicated in IBD. Metabolomics analysis shows 36 identified metabolites with significant differences, while the roles of these metabolites in IBD are still unknown. To further elucidate the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolites, we construct multi-omics biological correlation (MOBC) maps, which highlights gut microbial biotransformation deficiencies and significant alterations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Finally, we identify multi-omics biomarkers for IBD diagnosis, validated across multiple global cohorts (AUROC values ranging from 0.92 to 0.98). Our results offer valuable insights and a significant resource for developing mechanistic hypotheses on host-microbiome interactions in IBD.\nRecent studies have revealed that alterations in gut microbiota and metabolites are linked to changes in human health and various diseases, including Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)1,2. IBD is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the gastrointestinal tract and includes two main forms: Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)3,4. Millions of people worldwide are affected by IBD, and its incidence is shifting from developed to developing countries, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis5,6,7. The utilization of fecal shotgun metagenomics provides a powerful means to identify disease-associated species and understand co-metabolism between the host and microbiota at a higher taxonomic resolution8, while metabolomics reveals changes in gut metabolites as a messenger of information exchange between the gut microbiota and the host9. Combining metagenomics and metabolomics presents a promising approach for understanding the development of IBD and related gut environment alterations and offers a non-invasive biomarker for IBD.\nPrevious research has reported some signatures in gut microbiota and metabolites10,11,12, but the differences among various studies have made it challenging to validate these signatures across diverse groups, reducing the diagnostic value of the microbiome and metabolome in IBD. Therefore, there is an urgent need for multi-national, large-scale cohorts, multiomics characterization, standardized sampling and analysis, as well as model systems to uncover the relationship between gut microbiota and their functions with gut metabolites13. Cross-cohort integrative analysis (CCIA) is expected to address these challenges by assessing the robustness of disease-microbiome associations through the comparison of several case-control studies. The goal of CCIA is to identify consistent associations across various cohorts, thus minimizing the impact of biological or technical confounders. The remarkable performance of CCIA in some prior studies highlights its potential as a valuable tool in various research fields14,15,16.\nIn this work, we comprehensively analyzed nine metagenomic cohorts (N= 1363 cases) and four metabolomics cohorts (N= 398 cases) of IBD patients from different countries or regions through CCIA. Our objective was to identify specific gut bacteria, metabolites, and their associated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology (KO) genes that contribute to the development of IBD across diverse cohorts. We also aimed to create diagnostic models using disease-specific biomarkers from diverse cohorts to enhance IBD diagnosis. Furthermore, we sought to clarify the intricate relationships among these bacteria, metabolites, and KO genes within the context of IBD. Ultimately, our research holds the potential to provide fresh insights for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD.\nIn this study, we employed a multi-omics approach that integrates fecal metagenomics and metabolomics to investigate alterations in the gut microbiota of IBD. A total of 9 metagenomic cohorts from four different regions or countries (n= 1363 cases) were included in this study. These cohorts were divided into six discovery cohorts and three validation cohorts (Fig.1a, Supplementary Fig.1band Supplementary Table1). Additionally, we included four metabolomic cohorts (n= 398 cases), of which two external cohorts were examined using nontargeted metabolomics, and two in-house cohorts were examined using targeted metabolomics (Fig.1a).\naWe included a total of 9 fecal metagenomic cohorts (n= 1363) and 4 metabolomic cohorts (n= 398) from diverse geographic locations worldwide.bWe utilized the MetaPhlan3 tool for taxonomic profiling and HUMAnN3 for functional profiling to reprocess all raw metagenomic sequencing data. Additionally, we annotated the compound names from the metabolomics analysis with the same ID number using the HMDB (Human Metabolome Database).cThrough strict sample filtering, detailed bioinformatics analysis, and feature selection, we identified a series of representative features, including 31 bacterial features, 25 KO genes, and 13 metabolites. Subsequently, we developed machine learning models and used the features for the diagnosis of IBD. Finally, we introduced the multi-omics biological correlation (MOBC) maps framework to shed light on the interconnected relationships among gut bacteria, metabolites, and KO genes in IBD.\nTo ensure consistency in the bioinformatic analyses, we applied the MetaPhlan3 tool for taxonomic profiling and HUMAnN3 for functional profiling to reprocess all raw sequencing data. Furthermore, by annotating metabolite names with a unified ID using the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), we identified 79 metabolites that were shared among the four cohorts. These metabolites will be utilized in a cross-cohort analysis of metabolomics data (Fig.1b).\nFurthermore, our aim is to reveal the patterns of variation in gut microbiota and fecal metabolites through a comprehensive stati\nSource 5:\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

Nevertheless, integrating and analyzing such complex datasets poses significant challenges. Most notably, current analysis methods often yield extensive lists of disease-associated features (e.g., species, pathways, or metabolites), without capturing the multi-layered structure of the data. Here, we address this challenge by introducing \u201cMintTea\u201d, an intermediate integration-based approach combining canonical correlation analysis extensions, consensus analysis, and an evaluation protocol. MintTea identifies \u201cdisease-associated multi-omic modules\u201d, comprising features from multiple omics that shift in concord and that collectively associate with the disease. Applied to diverse cohorts, MintTea captures modules with high predictive power, significant cross-omic correlations, and alignment with known microbiome-disease associations. For example, analyzing samples from a metabolic syndrome study, MintTea identifies a module with serum glutamate- and TCA cycle-related metabolites, along with bacterial species linked to insulin resistance. In another dataset, MintTea identifies a module associated with late-stage colorectal cancer, includingPeptostreptococcusandGemellaspecies and fecal amino acids, in line with these species\u2019 metabolic activity and their coordinated gradual increase with cancer development. This work demonstrates the potential of advanced integration methods in generating systems-level, multifaceted hypotheses underlying microbiome-disease interactions.\nThe human gut microbiome is an incredibly complex ecosystem that has a marked, multifaceted impact on our health1,2,3, and a well-established role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases4,5,6,7,8. This appreciation for the importance and complexity of the gut microbiome has prompted a proliferation of multi-omic microbiome studies, which apply several molecular assays to the same set of samples, in the hope of capturing multiple layers of information concerning the involvement of the microbiome in disease. Among such multi-omic studies, one increasingly popular study design, for example, relies on collecting paired high-throughput microbiome and metabolome profiles9,10,11,12,13(e.g., coupling shotgun metagenomics sequencing and mass spectrometry). Unfortunately, however, while such multi-omic data clearly offer an exciting opportunity to study the microbiome and its role in human health, rigorous integrative analysis of such data remains highly challenging, as does using such data to gain a systems-level understanding of the microbiome14,15,16.\nA common aim of microbiome studies, and accordingly a key goal of many multi-omic microbiome analyses, is to identify disease-associated markers\u2014specific features from the various omics (e.g., certain species, pathways, or metabolites) whose measured abundances are strongly associated with the disease in question17. Such markers can later be used to predict disease, informing, for example, microbiome-based diagnosis18,19,20, or to suggest novel hypotheses concerning specific microbiome components or mechanisms that are at play, guiding future experimental and clinical studies. Given disease and control samples (or, more generally, some phenotypic measure of interest), disease-associated markers can be identified using a variety of statistical approaches, ranging from univariate statistical tests that are applied independently to each feature from each omic, to multivariate statistical methods that consider potential statistical dependencies between all features, such as partial least squares (PLS) or linear regression10,21,22,23,24. More recently, machine learning (ML) methods have also been applied widely for this purpose by first training some ML model for predicting the phenotype based on all features (either from a single omic or from multiple omics combined), and then using various model explainability methods for detecting informative features in this model11,12,25,26,27,28. Ultimately, however, such analyses generally result in long lists of features (from one or more omics) that are associated with the disease, without leveraging the multi-layered structure of multi-omic data and without offering clear, interpretable hypotheses concerning specific and coherent mechanisms underlying microbiome-disease interactions.\nSeveral preliminary attempts directed at addressing this challenge and considering both cross-omic dependencies and associations with a disease state have been introduced. For example, some microbiome studies took a two-step approach by first identifying features that are associated with the disease, and then clustering these features based on pairwise correlations between features29. This approach, however, may fail to identify features that are not sufficiently informative by themselves but can be incorporated into larger modules that, as a whole, are strongly predictive of the disease. Other studies aiming to tackle a similar challenge constructed cross-omic correlation networks while also including phenotypes of interest in the network30, or alternatively constructed separate networks for each host condition and then explored the differences between the networks to identify condition-specific motifs31,32,33. These approaches, however, are often hard to interpret given the high dimensionality of omic data, and the massive correlation networks that are accordingly produced.\nA particularly intriguing approach that may be utilized for addressing such analyses originates from the domain of multi-view learning, and is known as \u201cintermediate integration\u201c34,35. Unlike traditional multi-view approaches that directly combine raw features, either by na\u00efvely concatenating different omics into a single joint table (i.e., \u201cearly integration\u201d) or by modeling each omic independently and then creating a final ensemble model (i.e., \u201clate integration\u201d), intermediate integration seeks to combine features from the various omics (or \u2018views\u2019) into an intermediary representation level before utilizing them for downstream tasks such as classification34(Supplementary Fig.S1). This approach thus captures dependencies between omics and could accordingly be beneficial for generating multifaceted biological hypotheses. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA), for example, is a popular intermediate integration method that receives two feature tables, and outputs a linear transformation per table so that the resulting latent variables are maximally correlated36. CCA extensions that may be particularly relevant for microbiome multi-omic data include sparse CCA (sCCA)\u2014a CCA extension that includes sparsity constraints to deal with large numbers of features, and sparse generalized CCA (sGCCA), which generalizes sCCA to further support more than two views36,<a data-track=\"click\" data-track-action=\"reference anchor\"\nSource 6:\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation. The study\u2019s infrastructure resources, results, and data, which are available through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi\u2019omics Database (http://ibdmdb.org), provide the most comprehensive description to date of host and microbial activities in inflammatory bowel diseases.\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affect more than 3.5 million people, and their incidence is increasing worldwide1. These diseases, the most prevalent forms of which are Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterized by debilitating and chronic relapsing and remitting inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (for CD) or the colon (in UC). These conditions result from a complex interplay among host2,3, microbial4,<a data-track=\"click\" data-track-action=\"reference anchor\" data-track-label=\"link\" data-test=\"citation-ref\"\nSource 7:\nVasant G.

For each approach, feature type, and tool used, the number of studies employing it is shown in brackets. In some cases, metagenomic entities were engineered to produce features such as diversity metrics that were used for ML. Note that this table summarizes tools used as they were reported by study authors, e.g., QIIME without specifying which underlying algorithm was used for OTU clustering. Features used by studies for non-ML analyses are not reported here. **Supplementary Data**\n\n**Supplementary Data 1: Journal articles included in the survey of current ML practices for microbiomics.** One hundred peer-reviewed journal articles were surveyed to create a snapshot into current practices in the application of ML to microbiomics data.

Prolific research work in the past few decades have yielded valuable information regarding the relative taxonomic distribution of gut microbiota. Unfortunately, the microbiome data suffers from class imbalance and high dimensionality issues that must be addressed. In this study, we have implemented data engineering algorithms to address the above-mentioned issues inherent to microbiome data. Four standard machine learning classifiers (logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) decision trees) were implemented on a previously published dataset. The issue of class imbalance and high dimensionality of the data was addressed through synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and principal component analysis (PCA). Our results indicate that ensemble classifiers (RF and XGB decision trees) exhibit superior classification accuracy in predicting the host phenotype. The application of PCA significantly reduced testing time while maintaining high classification accuracy. The highest classification accuracy was obtained at the levels of species for most classifiers. The prototype employed in the study addresses the issues inherent to microbiome datasets and could be highly beneficial for providing personalized medicine.\n\n**Keywords:** machine learning, microbiome, personalized medicine, cystic fibrosis, data engineering\n\n# **1. Introduction**\n\nThe human body is home to trillions of microorganisms that contribute to both normal physiological functioning and disease (Fan and Pedersen 2021; Afzaal *et al.* 2022; Hou *et al.* 2022). The human microbiota, particularly those occupying the gut, influences the activity of multiple important organs of the body and is involved in several physiological functions (homeostasis, inflammation, and metabolism) (Fan and Pedersen 2021; Afzaal *et al.* 2022; Hou *et al.* 2022). In addition to that, the human microbiota is well documented to be implicated in numerous pathological conditions (Fan and Pedersen 2021; Afzaal *et al.* 2022; Hou *et al.* 2022). Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is known to be implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (Matsuoka and Kanai 2015; Qiu *et al.* 2022), irritable bowel syndrome (Chey and Menees 2018), urinary tract infection (Worby *et al.* 2022), pulmonary (Shi *et al.* 2021), and cardiovascular abnormalities (Novakovic *et al.* 2020), and many other conditions (Guinane and Cotter 2013; Hayden *et al.* 2020). The gut microbiota also influences brain function and is known to be involved in myriad diseased brain states like Alzheimer's disease (Varesi *et al.* 2022) and other psychiatric (MacQueen *et al.* 2017; Andrioaie *et al.* 2022) and neurological (Cryan *et al.* 2020; Suganya and Koo 2020) conditions.\n\nThe past numerous years have seen immense research work on the physiology of the human gut microbiota (Huttenhower *et al.* 2012; McDonald *et al.*). Big microbiome projects through whole genome sequencing techniques have yielded valuable information on the form and function of the human microbiota. The resulting data (Holmes 2019; Kuntal and Mande 2019; Shetty and Lahti 2019) has motivated the machine learning community to come up with predictive models (Pasolli *et al.* 2016; Thomas *et al.* 2019; Vangay *et al.* 2019; Haque and Mande 2019; Marcos-Zambrano *et al.* 2021) to infer host phenotypes based on careful feature selection. The modeling efforts are assumed to play an important role in providing personalized medicine (Haque and Mande 2019) by creating a connection between the taxonomic makeup of the human microbiome and disease\n\nconditions and/or human health (Li\u00f1ares-Blanco *et al.* 2022). In this regard, a number of machine learning studies have successfully predicted the host phenotypes (Thomas *et al.* 2019; Vangay *et al.* 2019; Hayden *et al.* 2020; Li\u00f1ares-Blanco *et al.* 2022; Giuffr\u00e8 *et al.* 2023) or disease states based on the taxonomic composition of the microbiome. Additionally, personalized medicine is also possible by developing novel therapeutics that can be utilized to target the microbiome in an individualized manner (Li\u00f1ares-Blanco *et al.* 2022).\n\nHowever, the classification of host phenotypes using the gut microbiome of human subjects has its own challenges that could hamper providing personalized medicine. The challenges could be two-fold arising both from the nature of the human microbiome data and from the nuances of using machine learning algorithms. Human microbiome data are often multidimensional (Thompson *et al.* 2017a; Armstrong *et al.* 2022) and sparse (Haque and Mande 2019; Pan 2021) along with significant variability between the subjects (Huttenhower *et al.* 2012; Zhang *et al.* 2019; Kodikara *et al.* 2022). In addition to that, microbiome data is often unbalanced (Anyaso-Samuel *et al.* 2021; D\u00edez L\u00f3pez *et al.* 2022) leading to the underrepresentation of the minority class in the classification of host phenotypes. To add to the problems of the clinical microbiologist working on personalized medicine for human subjects, machine learning models often come with a myriad of parameters that could be complex to deal with. As a result of the above-mentioned challenges, machine learning based classification based on microbiome data might lead to below-par performance accuracies (Bokulich *et al.* 2022; D\u00edez L\u00f3pez *et al.* 2022) and models that work on one dataset might not necessarily perform accurately when applied to similar other ones (LaPierre *et al.* 2019; Wang and Liu 2020; D\u00edez L\u00f3pez *et al.* 2022). Therefore, in order to effectively utilize human microbiome information for providing personalized medicine, one needs to address the above-mentioned issues arising out of the nature of the microbiome data.\n\nIn this study, we have addressed the issues of the unbalanced and multidimensional nature of microbiome datasets using data engineering approaches like synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) (Chawla *et al.* 2002) and principal component analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe 2011) etc. After data preprocessing, we have chosen\nSource 10:\n# Heterogeneous Causal Metapath Graph Neural Network for Gene-Microbe-Disease Association Prediction\n\nKexin Zhang 1 , Feng Huang 1 , Luotao Liu 1 , Zhankun Xiong 1 , Hongyu Zhang 1,2 , Yuan Quan 1,2\u2217 and Wen Zhang 1,2\u2217\n\n1 College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China\n\n2 Hubei Key Laboratory of Agricultural Bioinformatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan\n\n430070, China\n\n{kexinzhang, fhuang233, luotaoliu, xiongzk}@webmail.hzau.edu.cn, {zhy630, quanyuan, zhangwen}@mail.hzau.edu.cn\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe recent focus on microbes in human medicine highlights their potential role in the genetic framework of diseases. To decode the complex interactions among genes, microbes, and diseases, computational predictions of gene-microbe-disease (GMD) associations are crucial. Existing methods primarily address gene-disease and microbedisease associations, but the more intricate triplewise GMD associations remain less explored. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Causal Metapath Graph Neural Network (HCMGNN) to predict GMD associations. HCMGNN constructs a heterogeneous graph linking genes, microbes, and diseases through their pairwise associations, and utilizes six predefined causal metapaths to extract directed causal subgraphs, which facilitate the multi-view analysis of causal relations among three entity types. Within each subgraph, we employ a causal semantic sharing message passing network for node representation learning, coupled with an attentive fusion method to integrate these representations for predicting GMD associations. Our extensive experiments show that HCMGNN effectively predicts GMD associations and addresses association sparsity issue by enhancing the graph's semantics and structure.\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nContemporary human genetics focuses on unraveling the links between genotypes and diseases [Lappalainen and MacArthur, 2021]. Recent research increasingly connects genetic variant-related diseases with human microbes [Hall *et al.*, 2017; Manor *et al.*, 2020; Quan *et al.*, 2023]. Furthermore, there's growing evidence of causal relations among genes, microbes, and diseases, offering insights into complex disease pathogenesis from a multifactorial angle [Luca *et al.*, 2018]. Classical bioinformatics approaches, like multi-omics integration, while used for gene-microbe-disease (GMD) association discovery [Priya *et al.*, 2022; Markowitz *et al.*,\n\n2022], lack efficiency at scale. Machine learning-based methods, proposed as an efficient alternative, typically focus only on pairwise associations, such as gene-disease or microbedisease associations[Ata *et al.*, 2021; Wen *et al.*, 2021]. Their limitation is not considering the third entity's role in these associations. In contrast, exploring triple-wise GMD associations provides a more comprehensive understanding of biological mechanisms.\n\nSeveral approaches are applicable for triple-wise association prediction, including tensor decomposition [Wang *et al.*, 2018; Chen and Li, 2019; Chen and Li, 2020], hypergraph neural networks [Cheng *et al.*, 2022a; Liu *et al.*, 2022], and n-ary relational knowledge graph embedding methods [Wen *et al.*, 2016; Fatemi *et al.*, 2020; Liu *et al.*, 2021]. Models based on tensor decomposition, like those proposed by [Wang *et al.*, 2018] and [Chen and Li, 2020], have been used for predicting drug-protein-disease associations. [Liu *et al.*, 2022] introduced a method for anti-cancer drug synergy prediction using a multi-way relation-enhanced hypergraph, while [Cheng *et al.*, 2022a] developed an interactive hypergraph neural network for personalized product search. [Wen *et al.*, 2016] focused on representation learning in nary relational knowledge graphs. However, these methods typically treat triple-wise associations as instances of three entities without adequately considering the directional relations that indicate causal interactions among them.\n\nWith the advancement of microbiome genome-wide association studies, bidirectional interactions between genes and microbes have garnered attention [Nichols and Davenport, 2021]. Furthermore, causal relations between microbes and diseases have also been validated through causal inference methods such as Mendelian Randomization [Lv *et al.*, 2021]. Consequently, there exist intricate causal modes among genes, microbes, and diseases [Hughes *et al.*, 2020; Xu *et al.*, 2020], as summarized by [Luca *et al.*, 2018]. Illustratively, *NOD2* gene heightens the susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease through the modulation of *Enterobacteriaceae* abundance [Hall *et al.*, 2017]. Despite the insightful triple-wise associations revealed by these causal modes, modeling such interactions presents inherent challenges. Heterogeneous graphs, key in modeling complex systems, use metapaths to reveal specific connections and hidden patterns"

      "full_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to design a protein engineering approach for a synthetic enzyme that can catalyze atmospheric carbon fixation more efficiently than RuBisCO. Hmm, okay. Let me start by breaking down what I know about this topic.\n\nFirst off, atmospheric carbon fixation is a key process in photosynthesis and is carried out by organisms like plants and some bacteria. The enzyme involved here is often referred to as the carbon activator protein (CAP). RuBisCO is a well-known enzyme that acts as an analog of RuBisCII for these processes. It's known for its efficiency, which makes it important in photosynthesis.\n\nThe goal is to create another enzyme that can do this job much more efficiently than RuBisCO. I remember that RuBisCO has two subunits: a rigid part (A) and an flexible part (B). If we want something even better, maybe the synthetic enzyme should have three or four subunits? That might give it more flexibility to handle different carbon sources and improve efficiency.\n\nI think about what makes RuBisCO efficient. It uses its A subunit as a carbon receptor and B for catalysis. Maybe if I can create an enzyme with an even more complex structure, perhaps incorporating additional subunits or modified domains, that could enhance performance.\n\nWait, but creating a fully synthetic enzyme from scratch might be challenging without existing components like RuBisCO. So maybe we can take the existing RuBisCO and modify some of its parts to make it more efficient. For example, altering the structure of the A or B subunits or adding new domains that help in capturing different carbon sources.\n\nAnother thought: atmospheric carbon fixation occurs when light is absorbed by the plant's chlorophyll, activating the carbonyl group on the substrate. RuBisCO does this catalytically. If we can make a synthetic enzyme that mimics this activation process more effectively, it could fix carbon much faster than RuBisCO.\n\nPerhaps incorporating multiple enzymes or modifying existing ones in a way that their interactions change. I'm not entirely sure how, but maybe adding an additional step after the initial reaction to increase efficiency.\n\nWait, another angle: if RuBisCO's catalytic cycle is too slow for atmospheric conditions (which are high-energy, with light being part of the process), then any synthetic enzyme would need a very different mechanism. Maybe the new enzyme doesn't use light as effectively, but that seems counterintuitive since the goal is efficiency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the synthetic enzyme can involve additional steps or byproducts to make it faster. I'm not sure about that either. It's possible that some parts of the process are bypassed or optimized in a way that boosts overall speed.\n\nI should also consider the size and shape of the enzyme. Larger enzymes might not function as efficiently because their surface area is lower, but maybe they can have a more optimal active site for catalysis. Or perhaps the structure allows better diffusion of substrates through the active domain.\n\nAnother point: RuBisCO has been extensively studied and optimized for efficiency in photosynthesis. Maybe by taking inspiration from its structure and mechanisms, we can enhance it further. Perhaps using a different enzyme with a similar or more efficient carbon receptor.\n\nI'm also thinking about how to test this synthetic enzyme. Without existing data on such an enzyme's efficiency, it would be hard to validate. Maybe we could perform assays comparing the new enzyme's activity against RuBisCO under atmospheric conditions. But I don't have specific knowledge of what those assays might involve.\n\nIn summary, my initial thoughts are about modifying RuBisCO components or creating a new synthetic enzyme with more complex structures that enhance its catalytic efficiency. It seems like the key is either manipulating RuBisCO's parts or developing entirely different mechanisms inspired by photosynthesis.\n</think>\n\nTo design a protein engineering approach for a synthetic enzyme capable of catalyzing atmospheric carbon fixation with at least 10-fold efficiency over RuBisCO, consider the following structured approach:\n\n1. **Understand RuBisCO Mechanism**: RuBisCO is known for its efficient carbon fixation using two subunits (A and B). The A subunit acts as a receptor, while B facilitates catalysis.\n\n2. **Evaluate Potential Modifications**: \n   - Modify RuBisCO's subunits or structure to enhance efficiency.\n   - Consider creating an enzyme with multiple subunits (e.g., three or four) for increased flexibility.\n   \n3. **Explore Complex Structures**:\n   - Introduce additional domains or modified components that aid in carbon capture and activation.\n   \n4. **Leverage Photosynthesis Inspiration**: Develop a synthetic enzyme based on photosynthetic mechanisms, possibly incorporating additional steps to optimize efficiency.\n\n5. **Consider Efficiency Factors**:\n   - Explore whether a non-light-dependent mechanism could offer greater efficiency, though this is less likely as RuBisCO's function inherently involves light.\n   \n6. **Structural Insights**: Aim for an enzyme with an even more complex structure that allows for better surface area and active site optimization.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: Plan assays comparing the synthetic enzyme's activity against RuBisCO under atmospheric conditions to validate efficiency gains.\n\nBy focusing on modifying RuBisCO components or developing entirely new mechanisms, this approach aims to surpass RuBisCO's efficiency, potentially offering novel advancements in carbon fixation processes."

The results, outlined in Table 3, highlight their substantial contributions to overall improvement. Specifically, when comparing #1 vs. #3 and #1 vs. #2, it is evident that the pretrained structural features play a pivotal role in boosting performance. This aligns seamlessly with our rationale for incorporating prior structural knowledge. Moreover, given that the PCM module operates downstream of\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg</img>\nFigure 6: Comparison on the CATH, Ts50, and Ts500 datasets. The Short and Single-chain are subsets of CATH test set ALL.\n</F>\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_7_Figure_4.jpeg</img>\nFigure 7: AAR evaluation of functional enzyme design.\n</F>\n\nPSM, it is likely to directly benefit from the representation capabilities of PSM. Surprisingly, in the isolated comparison of #1 vs. #2, significant performance is enhanced even when utilizing only the PCM without the initialization parameters of the PEM. This intriguing finding, previously unexplored in SeqDesign studies, suggests that the PCM has acquired substantial knowledge of the protein language, thereby contributing significantly to improved SeqDesign performance. This observation gains further support in the comparison between #3 and #4, solidifying the conclusion that the PCM's acquired knowledge plays a vital role, diminishing the reliance on initialization parameters. The comprehensive analysis presented here highlights the logical and noteworthy advancements brought about by these pretrained modules in protein design.\n\n# 5 IN VITRO WET EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION\n\nTo further validate the reliability, we selected a commercially relevant enzyme with potential applications in production, the reversible glycine cleavage system (rGCS) [32, 43, 55], for wet lab experimentation. rGCS, known for efficiently fixing carbon to produce glycine in vitro, currently exhibits relatively low yields in\n\n<F>\n<img>_page_7_Figure_9.jpeg</img>\nFigure 8: Mutation effect analysis of P-protein.

Traditional rational enzyme design for rGCS has shown limited improvements in catalytic activity and other attributes. The rGCS, consisting of three proteins (P-protein decarboxylase, T-protein aminomethyltransferase, and H-protein shuttle), can fix two different one-carbon carbon sources to synthesize the two-carbon compound glycine. We focus on P-protein redesign in this work. For details on the structure and mutation preparation processes, please refer to Appendix.\n\nUtilizing rational design principles, we strategically chose mutation sites with anticipated substantial influence on mutation effects. Wet lab experiments assessing carbon fixation were conducted for approximately 40 guided mutations, and their effects are illustrated in Figure 8. The wet lab outcomes exhibit close alignment with in silico predictions, demonstrating a notable Spearman's ranking\n\ncorrelation of 70.1%. These results reinforce the practical efficacy of MetaEnzyme, pinpointing crucial sites for subsequent iterations in enhancing the P-protein's carbon-fixing capabilities.\n\n\nReferences for this section:\n- [32] Jianming Liu, Han Zhang, Yingying Xu, Hao Meng, An Ping Zeng, Nathalie Le Bot, Enda Bergin, and Fiona Gillespie. 2023.

This innovative strategy holds great promise in substantially augmenting product yield or productivity. This strategy has already been implemented in various microorganisms (Fig. 4).\nFunctional expression ofSpinacia oleraceaPRK andHydrogenovibrio marinusRubisco inSaccharomyces cerevisiaeled to a 90 % reduction of the by-product glycerol and a 10 % increase in ethanol production in sugar-limited chemostat cultures on a mixture of glucose and galactose [136]. A similar strategy, combined with continuous optimization, Kai Wang et al. achieved an astounding 33.7-fold enhancement in the ultimate titer of free fatty acids [122].\nThe PRK and Rubisco fromSynechocystissp. PCC 6803 were introduced intoE. coli. By balancing the ATP-generating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pathway with the ATP-consuming Rubisco, the CO2-fixing rate of the engineeredE. coliincreased by 870 %, and the malate production reached 387 mM [137]. In a similar manner, the introduction of the pyruvate to ethanol conversion pathway and the CBB pathway achieves energy balance for mixotrophic growth, with an average CO2consumption rate of 55.3 mg L\u22121h\u22121and an average ethanol productivity of 144.8 mg L\u22121h\u22121[138]. IntroducingSynechococcussp. PCC 7002 Rubisco intoR. eutrophaH16 enhanced its CO2utilization capacity, resulting in a 93.4 % increase in polyhydroxybutyrate production compared to the wild-type [121]. Several recent reviews have provided detailed summaries on this topic [34,139].\nIn addition to the mentioned products, theoretically, various other products, such as amino acids and organic acids, can also utilize Rubisco for CO2recycling during the production process. Although the utilization of Rubisco for carbon sequestration has achieved certain results, it is essential to acknowledge that Rubisco, being a large protein, can impose a burden on production, especially when co-expressed with chaperones. Additionally, fixing one molecule of CO2consumes one extra molecule of ATP, and this cost must be considered, particularly for strains with insufficient energy supply. If it does not impact bacterial growth, the application of Form II or Form III Rubisco, with higher solubility and activity, could also be considered. Rubisco's carbon sequestration may play a crucial role in the construction of artificial biological carbon fixation and new industrial raw material routes in the future. However, the carbon fixation capacity is limited by Rubisco's specificity and carboxylation efficiency, making the exploration or engineering of high-performance Rubisco the primary focus.\nAs the most crucial carbon-fixing enzyme in the nature, enhancing the carbon-fixing efficiency of Rubisco is crucial for global food security and climate change. In recent years, the progress in plant-chloroplast transformation has made it increasingly feasible to manipulate the Rubisco large subunit in plants. A better understanding of Rubisco biogenesis and regulation has provided guidance for strategies such as overexpression, substitution, or modification of the RbcL or RbcS. In contrast, advancements in engineering auxiliary factors like RCA, precursor supply, along with modifications to the photorespiration pathway, have shown to yield better results in enhancing Rubisco enzymatic activity and elevating overall plant photosynthetic efficiency, particularly under high CO2concentrations. The successful co-expression of five plant-derived chaperones has enabled assembly ofArabidopsis, potatoes, carrots, strawberries, and tobacco Rubisco inE. coli, making high-throughput mutagenesis and screening of all forms of Rubisco, including plant Rubisco, feasible. Moreover, by rapidly identifying crucial mutations that enhance Rubisco activity inE. coli, there is hope to transfer these mutation sites to plants and thus enhance the carbon fixation ability of plants. The utilization of Rubisco in production strains allows for the recovery of CO2generated during metabolic processes or enhances the carbon fixation pathways, thereby increasing the yield or productivity of chemicals. Furthermore, the transformation of heterotrophic microorganisms into autotrophic ones using Rubisco has broadened the scope of C1 utilization. This encompasses not only autotrophic carbon fixation but also the utilization of formate or methanol as viable energy sources for harnessing C1 compounds. With the maturation of renewable photoelectrochemical CO2-to-formate and CO2-to-methanol conversion technologies, this approach holds vast potential for diverse applications. In conclusion, the engineering of Rubisco to enhance its carbon fixation ability holds immense significance in addressing global climate change, ensuring global food security, and advancing the C1 industrial biotransformation industry. While there has been a degree of advancement in recent years, the accomplishments remain relatively limited. Achieving further successful transformations hinge on the continuous refinement of chloroplast transformation methods across diverse plant species. A more profound comprehension of Rubisco's structure and functionality is essential, particularly concerning selectivity, where knowledge gaps still exist. Moreover, a holistic grasp of Rubisco biogenesis within both plants and microorganisms is crucial for advancing this field.\nAuthors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nThis work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFC2103500), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32270057), and the DNL Cooperation Fund, CAS (DNL202014).\nPeer review under responsibility of KeAi Communications Co., Ltd.\nSource 8:\nBacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are protein-based organelle-like structures found in bacteria and archaea, measuring 40\u2013200 nanometers in diameter. They consist of a protein shell encapsulating enzymes and other proteins, functioning similarly to a membrane by being selectively permeable. BMCs were first observed in cyanobacteria in the 1950s and named carboxysomes due to their role in carbon fixation. They are involved in various metabolic functions, including carbon fixation (carboxysomes) and aldehyde oxidation (metabolosomes). The shell proteins of BMCs are composed of different protein families, including BMC-H, BMC-T, and BMC-P, which form the icosahedral or quasi-icosahedral shell. BMCs have evolved independently from viral capsids and play significant roles in global carbon fixation and the virulence of pathogens. They have potential biotechnological applications, such as enhancing carbon fixation in plants and creating custom bioreactors.\n\nThe chunk is: Carboxysomes encapsulate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and carbonic anhydrase in -fixing bacteria as part of a  concentrating mechanism. Bicarbonate is pumped into the cytosol and diffuses into the carboxysome, where carbonic anhydrase converts it to carbon dioxide, the substrate of RuBisCO. The carboxysome shell is thought to be only sparingly permeable to carbon dioxide, which results in an effective increase in carbon dioxide concentration around RuBisCO, thus enhancing  fixation. Mutants that lack genes coding for the carboxysome shell display a high  requiring phenotype due to the loss of the concentration of carbon dioxide, resulting in increased oxygen fixation by RuBisCO. The shells have also been proposed to restrict the diffusion of oxygen, thus preventing the oxygenase reaction, reducing wasteful photorespiration.\n\nMetabolosomes: aldehyde oxidation\nIn addition to the anabolic carboxysomes, several catabolic BMCs have been characterized that participate in the heterotrophic metabolism via short-chain aldehydes; they are collectively termed metabolosomes.\n\nIn 2014 it was proposed that the despite their functional diversity, the majority of metabolosomes share a common encapsulated chemistry driven by three core enzymes: aldehyde dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and phosphotransacylase. Because aldehydes can be toxic to cells and/or volatile, they are thought to be sequestered within the metabolosome. The aldehyde is initially fixed to coenzyme A by a NAD+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase, but these two cofactors must be recycled, as they apparently cannot cross the shell. These recycling reactions are catalyzed by an alcohol dehydrogenase (NAD+), and a phosphotransacetylase (coenzyme A), resulting in a phosphorylated acyl compound that can readily be a source of substrate-level phosphorylation or enter central metabolism, depending on if the organism is growing aerobically or anaerobically. It seems that most, if not all, metabolosomes utilize these core enzymes. Metabolosomes also encapsulate another enzyme that is specific to the initial substrate of the BMC, that generates the aldehyde; this is the defined signature enzyme of the BMC.\n\nPDU BMCs\n\nSome bacteria can use 1,2-propanediol as a carbon source. They use a BMC to encapsulate several enzymes used in this pathway (Sampson and Bobik, 2008). The PDU BMC is typically encoded by a 21 gene locus. These genes are sufficient for assembly of the BMC since they can be transplanted from one type of bacterium to another, resulting in a functional metabolosome in the recipient. This is an example of bioengineering that likewise provides evidence in support of the selfish operon hypothesis. 1,2-propanediol is dehydrated to propionaldehyde by propanediol dehydratase, which requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. Propionaldehyde causes DNA mutations and as a result is toxic to cells, possibly explaining why this compound is sequestered within a BMC. The end-products of the PDU BMC are propanol and propionyl-phosphate, which is then dephosphorylated to propionate, generating one ATP. Propanol and propionate can be used as substrates for growth.\n\nEUT BMCs\nEthanolamine utilization (EUT) BMCs are encoded in many diverse types of bacteria. Ethanolamine is cleaved to ammonia and acetaldehyde through the action of ethanolamine-ammonia lyase, which also requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. Acetaldehyde is fairly volatile, and mutants deficient in the BMC shell have been observed to have a growth defect and release excess amounts of acetaldehyde. It has been proposed that sequestration of acetaldehyde in the metabolosome prevents its loss by volatility. The end-products of the EUT BMC are ethanol and acetyl-phosphate. Ethanol is likely a lost carbon source, but acetyl-phosphate can either generate ATP or be recycled to acetyl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle or several biosynthetic pathways.\n\nBifunctional PDU/EUT BMCs\nSome bacteria, especially those in the genus Listeria, encode a single locus in which genes for both PDU and EUT BMCs are present. It is not yet clear whether this is truly a chimeric BMC with a mixture of both sets of proteins, or if two separate BMCs are formed.\n\nGlycyl radical enzyme-containing BMCs (GRM)\nSeveral different BMC loci have been identified that contain glycyl radical enzymes, which obtain the catalytic radical from the cleavage of s-adenosylcobalamin. One GRM locus in Clostridium phytofermentans has been shown to be involved in the fermentation of fucose and rhamnose, which are initially degraded to 1,2-propanediol under anaerobic conditions. The glycyl radical enzyme is proposed to dehydrate propanediol to propionaldehyde, which is then processed in a manner identical to the canonical PDU BMC.\n\nPlanctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia BMCs (PVM)\nDistinct lineages of Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia encode a BMC locus. The locus in Planctomyces limnophilus has been shown to be involved in the aerobic degradation of fucose and rhamnose. An aldolase is thought to generate lactaldehyde, which is then processed through the BMC, resulting in 1,2-propanediol and lactyl-phosphate.\n\nRhodococcus and Mycobacterium BMCs (RMM)\nTwo types of BMC loci have been observed in members of the Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium genera, although their actual function has not been established. However, based on the characterized function of one of the genes present in the locus and the predicted functions of the other genes, it was proposed that these loci could be involved in the degradation of amino-2-propanol. The aldehyde generated in this predicted pathway would be the extremely toxic compound methylglyoxal; its sequestration within the BMC could protect the cell.\n\nBMCs of unknown function (BUF)\nOne type of BMC locus does not contain RuBisCO or any of the core metabolosome enzymes, and has been proposed to facilitate a third category of biochemical transformations (i.e. neither carbon fixation nor aldehyde oxidation). The presence of genes predicted to code for amidohydrolases and deaminases could indicate that this BMC is involved in the metabolism of nitrogenous compounds.\n\nAssembly\n\nCarboxysomes\nThe assembly pathway for beta-carboxysomes has been identified, and begins with the protein CcmM nucleating RuBisCO. CcmM has two domains: an N-terminal gamma-carbonic anhydrase domain followed by a domain consisting of three to five repeats of RuBisCO small-subunit-like sequences. The C-terminal domain aggregates RuBisCO, likely by substituting for the actual RuBisCO small subunits in the L8-S8 holoenzyme, effectively cross-linking the RuBisCO in the cell into one large aggregate, termed the procarboxysome. The N-terminal domain of CcmM physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of the CcmN protein, which, in turn, recruits the hexagonal shell protein subunits via an encapsulation peptide on its C-terminus. Carboxysomes are then spatially aligned in the cyanobacterial cell via interaction with the bacterial cytoskeleton, ensuring their equal distribution into daughter cells.\n\nAlpha-carboxysome assembly may be different than that of beta-carboxysomes, as they have no proteins homologous to CcmN or CcmM and no encapsulation peptides. Empty carboxysomes have been observed in electron micrographs. Some micrographs indicate that their assembly occurs as a simultaneous coalescence of enzymes and shell proteins as opposed to the seemingly stepwise fashion observed for beta-carboxysomes. The formation of simple alpha-carboxysomes in heterologous systems has been shown to require just Rubisco large and small subunits, the internal anchoring protein CsoS2 and the major shell protein CsoS1A.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the shell proteins of both types of carboxysomes indicates they independently evolved, each from metabolosome ancestors.\nSource 9:\nThe kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of RuBisCO, the enzyme catalyzing the fixation of CO2 in the Calvin-Benson Cycle, is crucial for understanding photosynthesis. This KIE, driven by the preferential reaction of lighter CO2 isotopes, influences isotopic compositions in photosynthetic organisms. The enzyme's multi-step process involves forming a carbamate, binding RuBP, and forming a 2,3-enediol intermediate, where the KIE occurs. RuBisCO's specificity for CO2 over O2 and its carboxylation rate impact the KIE, with higher specificity leading to lower carboxylation rates. This trade-off reflects RuBisCO's evolution under varying atmospheric conditions. The KIE has implications for reconstructing Earth's photosynthetic history and environmental conditions, and for understanding plant productivity and relationships.\n\nThe chunk is: The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the isotopic fractionation associated solely with the step in the Calvin-Benson Cycle where a molecule of carbon dioxide () is attached to the 5-carbon sugar ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to produce two 3-carbon sugars called 3-phosphoglycerate (3 PGA). This chemical reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme RuBisCO, and this enzyme-catalyzed reaction creates the primary kinetic isotope effect of photosynthesis. It is also largely responsible for the isotopic compositions of photosynthetic organisms and the heterotrophs that eat them. Understanding the intrinsic KIE of RuBisCO is of interest to earth scientists, botanists, and ecologists because this isotopic biosignature can be used to reconstruct the evolution of photosynthesis and the rise of oxygen in the geologic record, reconstruct past evolutionary relationships and environmental conditions, and infer plant relationships and productivity in modern environments.\n\nReaction details and energetics\n\nThe fixation of  by RuBisCO is a multi-step process. First, a  molecule (that is not the  molecule that is eventually fixed) attaches to the uncharged \u03b5-amino group of lysine 201 in the active site to form a carbamate. This carbamate then binds to the magnesium ion (Mg2+) in RuBisCO's active site. A molecule of RuBP then binds to the Mg2+ ion. The bound RuBP then loses a proton to form a reactive, enodiolate species. The rate-limiting step of the Calvin-Benson Cycle is the addition of CO2 to this 2,3-enediol form of RuBP. This is the stage where the intrinsic KIE of Rubisco occurs because a new C-C bond is formed. The newly formed 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphophate molecule is then hydrated and cleaved to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 PGA). 3 PGA is then converted into hexoses to be used in the photosynthetic organism's central metabolism.\n\nThe isotopic substitutions that can occur in this reaction are for carbon, oxygen, and/or hydrogen, though currently only a significant isotope effect is seen for carbon isotope substitution. Isotopes are atoms that have the same number of protons but varying numbers of neutrons. \"Lighter\" isotopes (like the stable Carbon-12 isotope) have a smaller overall mass, and \"heavier\" isotopes (like the stable Carbon-13 isotope or radioactive Carbon-14 isotope) have a larger overall mass. Stable isotope geochemistry is concerned with how varying chemical and physical processes preferentially enrich or deplete stable isotopes. Enzymes like RuBisCO cause isotopic fractionation because molecules containing lighter isotopes have higher zero-point energies (ZPE), the lowest possible quantum energy state for a given molecular arrangement. For this reaction, 13CO2 has a lower ZPE than 12CO2 and sits lower in the potential energy well of the reactants. When enzymes catalyze chemical reactions, the lighter isotope is preferentially selected because it has a lower activation energy and is thus more energetically favorable to overcome the high potential-energy transition state and proceed through the reaction. Here, 12CO2 has a lower activation energy so more 12CO2 than 13CO2 goes through the reaction, resulting in the product (3 PGA) being lighter.\n\nEcological trade-offs influence isotope effects \nThe observed intrinsic KIEs of RuBisCO have been correlated with two aspects of its enzyme kinetics: 1) Its \"specificity\" for CO2 over O2, and 2) Its rate of carboxylation.\n\nSpecificity (SC/O) \nThe reactive enodiolate species is also sensitive to oxygen (O2), which results in the dual carboxylase / oxygenase activity of RuBisCO. This reaction is considered wasteful as it produces products (3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycolate) that must be catabolized through photorespiration. This process requires energy and is a missed-opportunity for CO2 fixation, which results in the net loss of carbon fixation efficiency for the organism. The dual carboxylase / oxygenase activity of RuBisCO is exacerbated by the fact that O2 and CO2 are small, relatively indistinguishable molecules that can bind only weakly, if at all, in Michaelis-Menten complexes. There are four forms of RuBisCO (Form I, II, III, and IV), with Form I being the most abundantly used form. Form I is used extensively by higher plants, eukaryotic algae, cyanobacteria, and proteobacteria. Form II is also used but much less widespread, and can be found in some species of Proteobacteria and in dinoflagellates. RuBisCOs from different photosynthetic organisms display varying abilities to distinguish between CO2 and O2. This property can be quantified and is termed \"specificity\" (Sc/o). A higher value of Sc/o means that a RuBisCO's carboxylase activity is greater than its oxygenase activity.\n\nRate of carboxylation (VC) and Michaelis-Menten constant (KC)\n\nThe rate of carboxylation (VC) is the rate that RuBisCO fixes CO2 to RuBP under substrate saturated conditions. A higher value of VC corresponds to a higher rate of carboxylation. This rate of carboxylation can also be represented through its Michaelis-Menten constant KC, with a higher value of KC corresponding to a higher rate of carboxylation. VC is represented by Vmax, and KC is represented as KM in the generalized Michaelis-Menten curve. Although the rate of carboxylation varies among RuBisCO types, RuBisCO on average fixes only three molecules of CO2 per second. This is remarkably slow compared to typical enzyme catalytic rates, which usually catalyze reactions at the rate of thousands of molecules per second.\n\nPhylogenetic patterns\n\nIt has been observed among natural RuBisCOs that an increased ability to distinguish between CO2 and O2 (larger values of Sc/o) corresponds with a decreased rate of carboxylation (lower values of VC and KC). The variation and trade-off between Sc/o and KC has been observed across all photosynthetic organisms, from photosynthetic bacteria and algae to higher plants. Organisms using RuBisCOs with high values of VC / KC, and low values of Sc/o have localized RuBisCO to areas within the cell with artificially high local CO2 concentrations. In cyanobacteria, concentrations of CO2 are increased using a carboxysome, an icosahedral protein compartment about 100\u00a0nm in diameter that selectively uptakes bicarbonate and converts it to CO2 in the presence of RuBisCO. Organisms without a CCM, like certain plants, instead utilize RuBisCOs with high values of Sc/o and low values of VC and KC. It has been theorized that groups with a CCM have been able to maximize KC at the expense of decreasing Sc/o, because artificially enhancing the concentration of CO2 would decrease the concentration of O2 and remove the need for high CO2 specificity. However, the opposite is true for organisms without a CCM, who must optimize Sc/o at the expense of KC because O2 is readily present in the atmosphere.\n\nThis trade-off between Sc/o and VC or KC observed in extant organisms suggest that RuBisCO has evolved through geologic time to be maximally optimized in its current, modern environment. RuBisCO evolved over 2.5 billion years ago when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 300 to 600 times higher than present day concentrations, and oxygen concentrations were only 5-18% of present-day levels. Therefore, because CO2 was abundant and O2 rare, there was no need for the ancestral RuBisCO enzyme to have high specificity. This is supported by the biochemical characterization of an ancestral RuBisCO enzyme, which has intermediate values of VC and SC/O between the extreme end-members.\nSource 10:\nCarbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) is an enzyme catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction, converting carbon monoxide (CO), water (H2O), and an electron acceptor (A) into carbon dioxide (CO2) and reduced acceptor (AH2). This bidirectional reaction is crucial for the carbon cycle, enabling organisms to utilize CO as an energy source and CO2 as a carbon source. CODH is found in diverse prokaryotes, including methanogens, aerobic carboxidotrophs, and acetogens, and can exist as a monofunctional enzyme or in a bifunctional cluster with acetyl-CoA synthase. The enzyme features metal complexes, such as Ni-[3Fe-4S] clusters, facilitating its catalytic activity. CODH plays a significant role in regulating atmospheric CO and CO2 levels, supporting microbial energy conservation and CO2 fixation.\n\nThe chunk is: EC 1.2.99\nIron enzymes\nZinc enzymes\nNickel enzymes\nIron-sulfur enzymes\nEnzymes of known structure\nProtein families\nDehydrogenase"

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create a systems biology framework that models and predicts cellular senescence trajectories across different tissue types. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, what is cellular senescence? From what I remember, it's the process where cells stop dividing after they reach certain stages, often linked with aging or stress. So the goal here is to track how these cells progress over time in various tissues.\n\nThe user mentioned including telomere dynamics, DNA damage response, and metabolic reprogramming. I know that telomeres are the ends of chromosomes, and their activity affects cell cycle progression. In senescence, especially early stages, telomeres often don't function properly because they get truncated as cells age or undergo stress.\n\nDNA damage is another key factor. Tumors accumulate DNA damage through exposure to radiation or chemicals. Cells need a pathway to repair this damage without triggering apoptosis. The DnA damage response (DDR) proteins come into play here, like PDK1 in cancer cells. These help the cell cycle continue.\n\nMetabolic reprogramming refers to changing the metabolism of the cell after DNA damage. In senescent cells, they might have altered metabolic profiles to either keep proliferating or prepare for new phases. Metabolic reprogramming could involve upregulating stress response genes or alternative energy pathways.\n\nNow, how do these factors interplay? The framework should integrate these aspects into a mathematical model. Maybe using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equations (PDEs) to simulate the rates of change in each cell type over time.\n\nI need to consider different tissue types. Tumors, fibres, and normal tissues are common. Each has distinct characteristics:\n\n1. **Tumour Tissues**: High DNA damage, active DDR pathways, and various metabolic reprogramming genes expressed.\n2. **Fibre Tissues**: Lower DNA damage compared to tumours but still high or middle levels of telomere dynamics. They might rely on DNA repair mechanisms more than tumours.\n3. **Normal Tissues**: Minimal DNA damage, telomere hypomethylation, and less metabolic reprogramming.\n\nEach tissue type will have its own model parameters:\n- **Tumour**: High damage \u2192 faster senescence?\n- **Fibre**: Lower damage but still active DDR \u2192 perhaps slower or different trajectory?\n- **Normal**: Lower DNA damage, telomeres not functioning \u2192 more stable cells?\n\nModeling the interactions could be complex. I might need to use systems biology techniques like gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and metabolic pathways. Maybe a modular approach where each tissue type has its own set of genes with known interactions.\n\nWait, but how do we model trajectories? They are dynamic processes, so perhaps using agent-based models (ABMs) could help simulate individual cell behaviors over time. But that might be more computational heavy.\n\nAnother idea: using network models to show the dependencies between telomeres, DNA damage, and metabolism. Then, each tissue type can have its own network with specific parameters affecting the progression towards senescence.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this covers everything. Maybe we should also consider external factors like environmental stressors or genetic mutations that affect these pathways. These could be modeled as variables in the model.\n\nI think a system of ODEs where each equation represents the change in cell states (telomere dynamics, DNA damage, metabolism) over time would work. Parameters for each equation could include rates of DNA repair, DDR activity, and metabolic reprogramming efficiency.\n\nBut I'm concerned about parameter estimation. Without knowing all the parameters, how can we validate the model? Maybe using computational techniques to estimate unknown parameters based on experimental data from these tissues.\n\nAlso, integrating with existing datasets would be important. We'd probably use public health or medical datasets for each tissue type to inform initial conditions and parameters.\n\nPotential challenges include:\n\n- **Complex Interactions**: Telomeres affect DNA repair indirectly through signaling pathways.\n- **Varying Dynamics Across Tissues**: Different parameters make each model unique, which could complicate integration.\n- **Computational Requirements**: Solving systems of ODEs can be computationally intensive, especially with many variables.\n\nHow about using a multi-agent system where each cell type has its own state trajectory influenced by these factors? That might capture the complexity better but would require a lot of computational power and data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use machine learning techniques to predict senescence trajectories based on existing gene expression data. But this would be more of an predictive model rather than a modeling framework for trajectory prediction.\n\nI think focusing on ODE-based models is the way to go for comprehensive and mechanistic understanding. Ensuring that each tissue type has its own set of parameters while sharing common underlying mechanisms could provide a robust framework.\n\nIn summary, I need to structure the framework with separate ODE systems for each tissue type, incorporating telomere dynamics, DNA damage response pathways, and metabolic reprogramming. Each system will have specific rates based on their biology, validated against experimental data. This approach allows comprehensive modeling of how cells move towards senescence in different tissues under various conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo create a comprehensive systems biology framework for modeling cellular senescence trajectories across different tissue types, we can structure the approach as follows:\n\n### 1. **Define Key Pathways and Processes**\n\n- **Telomere Dynamics**: Involves telomere truncation, DNA repair, and signaling pathways.\n- **DNA Damage Response (DDR)**: Includes proteins like PDK1 that promote DNA repair without apoptosis.\n- **Metabolic Reprogramming**: Adjustment of metabolism after damage, often altering energy pathways.\n\n### 2. **Model Each Tissue Type Separately**\n\nEach tissue type can be represented by a separate system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to account for its unique characteristics:\n\n#### **Tumour Tissues**\n- High DNA damage \u2192 faster senescence.\n- Active DDR pathways.\n- Complex metabolic reprogramming.\n\n#### **Fibre Tissues**\n- Lower DNA damage than tumours but still high or middle levels of telomere dynamics.\n- Less reliance on DDR compared to tumours.\n- Simpler metabolite profiles (e.g., fewer stress response genes).\n\n#### **Normal Tissues**\n- Minimal DNA damage \u2192 slower progression?\n- Telomeres hypomethylated \u2192 impaired DNA repair potential.\n- Less metabolic reprogramming.\n\n### 3. **Parameterization and Validation**\n\n- Use parameter estimation techniques based on experimental data from each tissue type.\n- Validate models with datasets from known senescence trajectories in these tissues.\n\n### 4. **Model Interactions and Dependencies**\n\n- Telomeres influence DNA repair indirectly via signaling pathways like c-Fos/Jothi-Fos.\n- Different tissues have varying levels of DNA damage \u2192 different rates of DDR activity.\n\n### 5. **Multi-Tissue Integration**\n\n- Use a modular approach where each tissue type has its own set of parameters and equations.\n- Combine models to study inter-tissue interactions and environmental stressors.\n\n### 6. **Computational Tools and Techniques**\n\n- Utilize ODE solvers for system simulation.\n- Consider agent-based models (ABMs) for individual cell behaviors.\n- Use computational intelligence techniques for parameter estimation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy structuring the framework with separate ODE systems per tissue type, we can comprehensively model cellular senescence trajectories. Each tissue's unique biology and parameters will define its specific trajectory, supported by validated experimental data and computational tools. This approach provides a mechanistic understanding of how telomeres, DNA damage, and metabolism collectively influence cell fate in various tissues."

      "full_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand the concept of \"negligible senescence\" as proposed by Aubrey de Grey. From what I gather, senescence is the process where cells age and stop dividing, right? So, cells that have reached the end of their life cycle tend towards this senescence. The idea of negligible senescence seems to be about reversing or minimizing this loss.\n\nAubrey de Grey is working on strategies to remove these dead cells from tissues, like removing senescent cells so they don't stay around as they should. There are seven strategies mentioned: exercise for muscle, activating the immune system against them, destroying gene therapy with enzymes, eliminating extracellular garbage by vaccination, using new enzymes in stem cells, fixing mitochondrial issues through nuclear DNA repair, addressing cancer mutations by deleting telomerase and introducing new stem cells, and trying to negate telomerase effects through radical methods.\n\nWait, so for muscle, exercise is one strategy. That makes sense because muscles can recover over time with exercise. But what about other tissues? The strategies mention removing senescent cells in various ways, like activating the immune system or using gene therapy. But does everyone's tissue needs a different approach?\n\nI'm trying to think of real-world examples. They mentioned that some tissues might require specific treatments. For example, if we're talking about fat cells, maybe they'd need methods to remove excess lipofuscin? Or for inner skin cells, perhaps using gene therapy. But I'm not sure how effective these methods would be without any prior knowledge or evidence.\n\nAlso, there's this part where the cell takes in new enzymes every decade if telomerase isn't working properly in stem cells. Telomerase is involved in aging, right? It adds a protective tail to chromosomes. If it doesn't work, could that lead to issues like cancer? The idea here is to introduce new stem cells periodically to bypass telomerase issues.\n\nI'm also wondering about the effectiveness of these strategies. Would it be feasible for tissues that already have some senescence, or would they require significant intervention? How long does this process take? Can it be accelerated?\n\nAnother point is how this relates to ageless living or other forms of life extension. If we can reverse senescence, could that lead to an infinite lifespan? But I know that while there's a lot of research into aging and rejuvenation, reversing senescence isn't something everyone sees as possible yet.\n\nI'm also curious about the impact on individual cells. Is it just removing fat or other cellular components, or does it affect entire tissues? If it's tissue-wide, would this have broader implications for health?\n\nMoreover, Aubrey de Grey mentions that mitochondrial DNA has a lot of free radicals, so fixing that might be crucial. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, and they're often damaged by free radicals from the environment or DNA damage. By introducing suitably modified copies of mitochondrial genes into the nucleus, deGrey suggests that these mitochondria could repair their damage.\n\nBut how would this process work in practice? It might require careful engineering to ensure that the changes don't disrupt existing normal functions. There's a risk of introducing harmful mutations, so there must be rigorous quality control measures in place.\n\nI'm also thinking about the long-term effects. If these strategies can significantly reduce or eliminate senescence, could that lead to an infinite lifespan? But I know that any process related to aging is still tied to some form of entropy and irreversibility, which means it's not entirely certain if this reversal will happen naturally.\n\nIn terms of scientific progress, deGrey's work might be groundbreaking. He's co-founded the SENS Foundation and has been involved in various collaborative research projects. It shows that there are plausible avenues for rejuvenation beyond traditional medical treatments, especially in areas like tissue engineering or genetic modification.\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't completely solve all the issues associated with aging. It just addresses one aspect of it\u2014reducing senescence. There's still a lot to explore in terms of how to overcome telomeres, maintain cellular health, and ensure that any treatments are safe and effective long-term.\n\nOverall, I'm interested in how these strategies could be implemented practically, what the mechanisms might look like, and whether they hold up under scrutiny with current medical knowledge. It's a fascinating area that combines biology, genetics, and engineering to tackle one of the biggest challenges humanity faces.\n</think>\n\nAubrey de Grey's concept of \"negligible senescence\" offers a potential path toward rejuvenation by addressing the loss of cellular senescence through strategic interventions across tissues. Here's an organized summary of the key aspects:\n\n1. **Understanding Senescence and Negligible Senescence:**\n   - Senescence refers to the process where cells age, halting division beyond a certain point. Negligible senescence aims to reduce or eliminate this loss.\n\n2. **Strategies for Removing Senescent Cells:**\n   - **Muscle Tissues:** Exercise is a key strategy, as muscles recover over time with activity.\n   - **Other Tissues:** Various methods are proposed, including activating the immune system, gene therapy, and using enzymes to remove extracellular components.\n\n3. **Tissue-Specific Approaches:**\n   - Different tissues may require distinct techniques. For example, addressing fat cells might involve lipofuscin removal, while inner skin cells could be tackled with gene therapy.\n\n4. **Mitochondrial Health:**\n   - Mitochondria are critical for cellular power but often accumulate free radicals. Fixing mitochondrial issues by introducing suitably modified nuclear genes is crucial.\n\n5. ** Telomerase and Stem Cell Interventions:**\n   - Telomerase works to protect chromosomes, so addressing telomerase failure through periodic new stem cell introduction could prevent aging-related issues.\n\n6. **Potential for Ageless Living:**\n   - The idea of reversing senescence could lead to an infinite lifespan if all factors are addressed, though this remains speculative due to irreversibility principles.\n\n7. **Scientific Foundation and Progress:**\n   - deGrey's research is at the forefront of rejuvenation, co-founding the SENS Foundation, and involving collaborative projects, indicating significant potential but requiring rigorous evidence.\n\n8. **Practical Implementation and Safety:**\n   - Practical implementation requires engineering to avoid harmful mutations, with strict quality control measures. Long-term safety must be ensured as aging processes remain uncertain.\n\n9. **Broader Implications:**\n   - This approach addresses one aspect of aging but leaves other challenges like telomere maintenance untouched, suggesting a need for further research in engineering and biology.\n\nIn conclusion, de Grey's strategies are groundbreaking, offering new avenues for rejuvenation by tackling the loss of cellular senescence. While practical implementations and long-term safety are key concerns, this work highlights potential future possibilities in extending human lifespan through innovative biological and engineering approaches.",
      "context": "Source 1:\n\nSource 2:\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 12331018).\nSource 3:\n## CORRESPONDENCE\n\nThe emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 2005 has proved to be massively important in this direction as the technology is used to determine the order of nucleotides in entire genomes or targeted regions of DNA or RNA and has revolutionized biological research, allowing scientists to study biological systems at a level never tried before. It can provide new insights into the nature of genes and proteins thought to be associated with cancer, and the application of evolving molecular techniques to the study of cancer has also provided markers that have led to new advances in tumor diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment which have proven to be immensely helpful in advancing precision oncology [26]. There are many potential biomarkers in cancer. and many prognostic biomarkers are therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.\n\n#### 3. Molecular Basis of Cellular Reprogramming and Cancer Therapy\n\nThe important part of tumorigenesis is that cancers of different tissues utilize somewhat different patterns to finally converge to a common path of cancer development witnessed in the form of tumor growth followed by angiogenesis, invasion, and metastases. All such developments are ultimately guided by genetic and epigenetic changes associated with cancer cells and supported by certain tissue-specific factors that enable the tissue to exploit these changes to its specific needs resulting in reprogramming of the molecular events utilized by different cancer cells, and no gene change is thought to be common to all cancers [27]. Because the realization of uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation remain the most evident cause of cancer, certain alterations in the pattern of cell death and differentiation promoting overall cell survival could further aggravate the gradual transformation of tissue from normal to tumorous and from benign to metastatic. Certain disruptions of the physiologic balance between cell proliferation and cell death prolonging cell survival and proliferation are thought to be an important step in carcinogenesis. Expectedly, observations confirm that the evasion of cell death by apoptosis and autophagy is the hallmark property of most if not all cancers actively contributing to cell growth and proliferation. Apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death, also known as type 1 cell death, is mediated through caspase degradation activated by mitochondria. It is employed for removing damaged cells and is crucial to the early development and overall maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Loss of apoptotic control enables cancer cells to survive longer allowing more time for the accumulation of mutations which can deregulate cell proliferation and differentiation and stimulate angiogenesis and metastasis. Autophagy is the major intracellular degradation system mediated by lysosomes that involve the engulfment of unwanted proteins and damaged organelles in double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes, for their destruction and recycling. Autophagy can play a protective role in promoting cell survival, but excessive autophagy plays a suppressive role by inducing autophagic cell death, known as type 2 cell death. Autophagy has universally been accepted to play a tumor-suppressive role at the early stage, while defective autophagy is associated with tumorigenesis. Deregulation of these essential catabolic pathways contributes to the development of a tumor and is often involved in promoting invasion and metastasis Cancer cells can develop novel mechanisms for evading apoptosis and autophagy and new discoveries direct toward the possible interrelationship between these two catabolic pathways. Evidence suggests that inhibition of apoptosis causes autophagy, while autophagy inhibition induces apoptosis. It may\n\nhelp the key proteins and intermediates involved with these pathways to be exploited in cancer therapeutics successfully. Furthermore, cancer cells maintaining constant proliferative capacity may be guided by their transformation into everlasting non-senescent cells. In this regard, telomeres are the specific repeating DNA structures found at the ends of the chromosome of the cell, which protect the genome against unnecessary nucleolytic degradation, recombination, repair, and interchromosomal interactions. Telomeres are maintained by telomerase which adds nucleotides to telomeres to keep them from getting shorter. Germ cells typically express high levels of telomerase to maintain telomere length. In somatic cells, telomere length usually decreases with the lapse of time, leading cells to undergo senescence with age. Loss of cells in this way generally acts as a barrier to tumor growth which the transformed cells escape as they maintain their telomeres despite repeated cell divisions because these cells are able to express a lot of active telomerase. Telomerase has become a potential target in cancer therapeutics as they are over-expressed in transformed cancer cells and cancer stem cells in diverse forms of malignancies. Telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMM) are used by cancer cells through telomerase activation and sometimes by alternate means called alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT).to avoid apoptosis. Anti-telomerase therapeutics have been developed to selectively target cancer cells to induce cell death by apoptosis without affecting normal cells [28].\n\n## CORRESPONDENCE\n\nAn important feature of cancer is that the population of cells that make up cancer is profoundly heterogeneous at the genetic, and epigenetic levels. Tumors usually represent a heterogeneous mass of distinctly differentiated cells that include connective tissue cells, immune cells, cancer stem cells, and vasculature, and these subpopulations of cells can be further distinguished by a variety of features impacting their phenotype that generally involve genetic alterations. Tumors develop this feature mainly because the cancer genome is unstable due to accumulating numbers of cancer-causing gene mutations. Genomic instability further promotes genetic diversity by providing the raw material for the generation of tumor heterogeneity [29]. There are transposable elements (TEs) present in the cells called 'jumping genes', the repetitive sequences of DNA that move from place to place in the genome by different means. and represent almost half of the human genome. They represent a powerful means of genetic modification and have played an important role in the evolution of genomes. TEs are typically regulated since the early stage of development and throughout the lifespan by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications and are crucial for maintaining genomic stability through the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of the cell. Dysregulation of TEs has been implicated in different types of human cancers, with the possibility of chromosomal aberrations, oncogenic activation, transcriptional dysregulation, and non-coding RNA aberrations as potential mechanisms underlying the development of cancer. Further, there are fragile points in every genome where the DNA is more likely to be mutated when the genome is replicated. These breakage points have frequently been linked to genetic and heritable disorders like cancer. Moreover, there can be mutations present in certain genes, known as mutator mutations, that further increase the inherent rate of genomic changes, resulting in even greater genetic instability that leads to the accumulation of multiple oncogenic mutations within a cellular lineage. Not all such changes are \"malignant\", but the rate of such development could translate into cancer manifestation at different stages in a lifetime. Mutator mutations and genetic instability are generalized concepts in cancer genetics, referred to as mutator hypothesis, that relates to those few mutations that lead to an enhanced rate of the gene mutations leading to chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, and deregulation of activities related to DNA damage and repair [31]. Furthermore, the gradual accumulation of oxidative damage to critical\n\nbiomolecules such as DNA, due to persistent metabolic oxidative stress and inflammation also contributes to genomic instability and related diseases, including cancer indicating relevant measures for prevention and cure. This feature of cancer cells has also guided researchers to kill vulnerable cells by inducing lethal genomic instability in the cells through radiation therapy and chemotherapy. It has been a rather nonselective means of killing cancer cells with associated side effects which could be perfected by devising methods to selectively target the affected cells inside the body. Researchers have begun examining the genomic data of vulnerable individuals to allow clinicians to embark on the path of personalized radiation therapy.\n\nA crucial component of tissue heterogeneity found in tumors is cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are at the forefront of cancer research owing to their potential to induce cancer development. Recent studies have shown that there can be different subpopulations of CSCs within the tumor mass identified by cancer stem cell surface markers on normal stem cells with similar characteristics as normal stem cells, such as self-renewal and multilineage differentiation capabilities, with a much higher half-life than that of most other cells [32]. The intrinsic properties of self-renewal, multipotency, and longevity render stem cells more susceptible to accumulating gene mutations leading to neoplastic transformation, as proposed by the cancer stem cell hypothesis [33,34]. They have been found to be the key driver of tumorigenicity, tumor heterogeneity, recurrence, and drug resistance in many cancer types, and different targeted molecules, including nanoparticles-based drug delivery systems, are being tested for effectively targeting CSC related pathways for cancer treatment [35,36,37.38]. Moreover, the immune cells in the tumor mass could be hugely different, and an emerging finding of tumor heterogeneity is that tumors from different patients show a different degree of immune cell infiltration and immune cell composition. The immunologically \"hot\" tumors present elevated levels of T -cell infiltration, so these tumors are more susceptible to immunotherapy than immunologically \"cold\" tumors that don't allow similar T -cell infiltration. This immunogenic heterogeneity simply impacts treatment outcomes and may direct treatment planning [39,40].\nSource 4:\n\nSource 5:\n# Stochastic branching models for the telomeres dynamics in a model including telomerase activity\n\nA.

Villemonais3*,*8\n\n17th July 2024\n\n#### **Abstract**\n\nTelomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides at the end of chromosomes, whose evolution over time is intrinsically related to biological ageing. In most cells, with each cell division, telomeres shorten due to the so-called end replication problem, which can lead to replicative senescence and a variety of age-related diseases. On the other hand, in certain cells, the presence of the enzyme telomerase can lead to the lengthening of telomeres, which may delay or prevent the onset of such diseases but can also increase the risk of cancer.\n\nIn this article, we propose a stochastic representation of this biological model, which takes into account multiple chromosomes per cell, the effect of telomerase, different cell types and the dependence of the distribution of telomere length on the dynamics of the process.

In addition, we investigate numerically the impact of the model parameters on biologically relevant quantities, such as the Hayflick limit and the Malthusian parameter of the population of cells.\n\n**Keywords:** branching processes, non-conservative semi-groups, many-to-one formula, quasi-stationary distribution, Hayflick limit, telomerase.\n\n**MSC:** 60J80, 60J85, 60K40\n\n# **1 Introduction**\n\nTelomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides located at the ends of linear chromosomes that act as protective caps to ensure the genomic stability.

In addition, research has shown that factors such as lifestyle, genetics and oxidative stress can also impact telomere length dynamics [50, 47, 38].\n\nOn the other hand, some cell types can express an enzyme called telomerase. This DNA polymerase has the ability to add telomeric repeats to the end of telomeres during DNA replication, which can compensate the effects of telomere shortening but also plays an important role in the development and evolution of cancer [34, 6].\n\nIn the past 30 years, mathematical modelling has played an important role in understanding the long-term behaviour of the distribution of telomere length in cells and the associated health implications. One of the earliest (deterministic) models for the evolution of telomere lengths was given in [37], which mirrored the results seen in *in vitro* experiments. Shortly after, Arino et al. [1] and Olofsson and Kimmel [41] reframed this model in terms of a branching process to obtain both exact and asymptotic results for the behaviour of telomeres. Since then, there have been a wide range of stochastic models for telomere lengths, both with and without the presence of telomerase, for the purpose of understanding the role of the shortest telomere in senescence [7, 14], calculating the time until senescence [22], parameter inference [36] and calculating the stationary distribution [36]. We also refer the reader to [43, 61, 44] for computational analysis of both deterministic and stochastic models.\n\nIn this paper, our aim is to propose a mathematical model that describes the evolution in continuous time of the whole population of cells, whose dynamics depend explicitly on the lengths of their telomeres. This is in accordance with recent empirical evidence [7, 14, 62], which suggests a strong link between the length of the shortest telomere and the cell's behaviour. In addition, we also allow for different cell types, multiple chromosomes per cell *and* take into account the effect of telomerase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model that takes all these components into account simultaneously.\n\nAmong the models in the aforementioned literature, some of them describe the whole cell population, while others describe a single cell lineage. While both approaches are relevant, we emphasize that the latter approach does not appropriately describe the distribution of the whole population when reproduction and/or senescence rates of a cell depend on its telomere lengths. This is due to an imbalance of mass compared to the whole population of cells. To counteract this issue, one needs to appropriately weight the single linear process, as in the *many-to-one formula*. In the setting of telomere dynamics, this is given in Lemma 3.3, which allows one to represent the first moment of the entire cell population by the average behaviour of a typical trajectory in the population, appropriately weighted. This result allows one to more easily analyse the behaviour of the branching process, and provides a useful tool for numerical simulations.\n\nOne of the main mathematical contributions of this paper, Theorem 4.5, is related to the asymptotic behaviour of the first moment of the particle system. In the case that telomerase is present and compensates the attrition of telomeres, so that the population grows indefinitely, we show two things. Firstly, the distribution of an average cell and its telomere lengths converges with time, and secondly, the first moment of the population size grows asymptotically exponentially fast. This analysis is related to the theory of quasistationary distributions (see e.g. [12, 56, 39]).\nSource 6:\n# Co-attenuated biochronometers of truncated timing phase in cloned sheep Dolly's cells\n\nof microorganisms.

In contrast to epidemiological studies revealing the association of telomere length with age, age-related diseases, and cancers, the role of telomeres in regulation of transcriptome and epigenome and the role of genomic variations in telomere lengthening are not extensively analyzed. This is explained by the fact that experimental assays for telomere length measurement are resource consuming, and there are very few studies where high-throughput genomics, transcriptomics, and/or epigenomics experiments have been coupled with telomere length measurements. Recent development of computational approaches for assessment of telomere length from whole genome sequencing data pave a new perspective on integration of telomeres into high-throughput systems biology analysis framework. Herein, we review existing methodologies for telomere length measurement and compare them to computational approaches, as well as discuss their applications in large-scale studies on telomere length dynamics.\nKeywords:age-related diseases; cancers; gene expression; telomere length.\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

It involves biological, psychological, physiological, and social changes. In humans, ageing brings physical, psychological, and social changes, and increases the risk of diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. Ageing theories include the damage concept and programmed ageing, while dietary calorie restriction has shown to slow ageing in animals. Though life-extending effects in humans are uncertain, health benefits from calorie restriction are well-established. Ageing is defined by functional and chronological age, and can be viewed through various lenses including mortality, functional decline, and senescence. Unlike potentially immortal species, humans and other mortal species experience cellular senescence and limited lifespans. Signs of ageing include hearing loss, wrinkles, fertility decline, and increased disease risk. The biological basis of ageing is still being understood, with factors like DNA damage, genetic instability, and accumulation of waste contributing to the ageing process. Prevention strategies include caloric restriction, a healthy diet, and regular physical exercise. The global population is ageing, posing social and economic challenges that require policy interventions to ensure economic security and access to health care for older individuals.\n\nThe chunk is: Molecular and cellular hallmarks of ageing \nIn a detailed review, Lopez-Otin and colleagues (2013), who discuss ageing through the lens of the damage theory, propose nine metabolic \"hallmarks\" of ageing in various organisms but especially mammals:\n genomic instability (mutations accumulated in nuclear DNA, in mtDNA, and in the nuclear lamina)\n telomere attrition (the authors note that artificial telomerase confers non-cancerous immortality to otherwise mortal cells)\n epigenetic alterations (including DNA methylation patterns, post-translational modification of histones, and chromatin remodelling)\n loss of proteostasis (protein folding and proteolysis)\n deregulated nutrient sensing (relating to the Growth hormone/Insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling pathway, which is the most conserved ageing-controlling pathway in evolution and among its targets are the FOXO3/Sirtuin transcription factors and the mTOR complexes, probably responsive to caloric restriction)\n mitochondrial dysfunction (the authors point out however that a causal link between ageing and increased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species is no longer supported by recent research)\n cellular senescence (accumulation of no longer dividing cells in certain tissues, a process induced especially by p16INK4a/Rb and p19ARF/p53 to stop cancerous cells from proliferating)\n stem cell exhaustion (in the authors' view caused by damage factors such as those listed above)\n altered intercellular communication (encompassing especially inflammation but possibly also other intercellular interactions\ninflammageing, a chronic inflammatory phenotype in the elderly in the absence of viral infection, due to over-activation and a decrease in the precision of the innate immune system.\n\nMetabolic pathways involved in ageing \nThere are three main metabolic pathways which can influence the rate of ageing, discussed below:\n the FOXO3/Sirtuin pathway, probably responsive to caloric restriction\n the Growth hormone/Insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling pathway\n the activity levels of the electron transport chain in mitochondria and (in plants) in chloroplasts.\n\nIt is likely that most of these pathways affect ageing separately, because targeting them simultaneously leads to additive increases in lifespan.\n\nProgrammed factors\nThe rate of ageing varies substantially across different species, and this, to a large extent, is genetically based. For example, numerous perennial plants ranging from strawberries and potatoes to willow trees typically produce clones of themselves by vegetative reproduction and are thus potentially immortal, while annual plants such as wheat and watermelons die each year and reproduce by sexual reproduction. In 2008 it was discovered that inactivation of only two genes in the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana leads to its conversion into a potentially immortal perennial plant. The oldest animals known so far are 15,000-year-old Antarctic sponges, which can reproduce both sexually and clonally.\n\nClonal immortality apart, there are certain species whose individual lifespans stand out among Earth's life-forms, including the bristlecone pine at 5062 years or 5067 years, invertebrates like the hard clam (known as quahog in New England) at 508 years, the Greenland shark at 400 years, various deep-sea tube worms at over 300 years, fish like the sturgeon and the rockfish, and the sea anemone and lobster. Such organisms are sometimes said to exhibit negligible senescence. The genetic aspect has also been demonstrated in studies of human centenarians.\nSource 9:\nRejuvenation is a medical discipline aimed at reversing the aging process, distinct from life extension which seeks to slow it. Historically, myths and legends depicted rejuvenation as achievable through magic or supernatural intervention. Ancient myths and explorers, such as the Chinese emperor seeking a rejuvenating pearl and Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n searching for the Fountain of Youth, illustrate humanity's long-standing fascination. Early medical attempts included grafting monkey testicles and using live animal embryo cells. Modern rejuvenation research focuses on repairing aging damage, hormone replacement, stem cell therapy, and genetic interventions. Experiments show promise in reversing aging signs in animals, while clinical trials and epigenetic reprogramming gain traction. Cosmetic changes offer superficial youth, but many rejuvenation products remain ineffective. Initiatives like the Mprize competition and the SENS Foundation aim to advance rejuvenation therapies, proposing strategies to address aging damage at a cellular level.\n\nThe chunk is: Stem cell regenerative medicine uses three different strategies:\n Implantation of stem cells from culture into an existing tissue structure\n Implantation of stem cells into a tissue scaffold that guides restoration\n Induction of residual cells of a tissue structure to regenerate the necessary body part\n\nA salamander can not only regenerate a limb, but can regenerate the lens or retina of an eye and can regenerate an intestine. For regeneration the salamander tissues form a blastema by de-differentiation of mesenchymal cells, and the blastema functions as a self-organizing system to regenerate the limb.\n\nYet another option involves cosmetic changes to the individual to create the appearance of youth. These are generally superficial and do little to make the person healthier or live longer, but the real improvement in a person's appearance may elevate their mood and have positive side effects normally correlated with happiness. Cosmetic surgery is a large industry offering treatments such as removal of wrinkles (\"face lift\"), removal of extra fat (liposuction) and reshaping or augmentation of various body parts (abdomen, breasts, face).\n\nThere are also, as commonly found throughout history, many fake rejuvenation products that have been shown to be ineffective. Chief among these are powders, sprays, gels, and homeopathic substances that claim to contain growth hormones. Authentic growth hormones are only effective when injected, mainly due to the fact that the 191-amino acid protein is too large to be absorbed through the mucous membranes, and would be broken up in the stomach if swallowed.\n\nThe Mprize scientific competition is under way  to deliver on the  mission of extending healthy human life. It directly accelerates the development of revolutionary new life extension therapies by awarding two cash prizes: one to the research team that breaks the world record for the oldest-ever mouse; and one to the team that develops the most successful late-onset rejuvenation. Current Mprize winner for rejuvenation is  Steven Spindler. Caloric restriction (CR), the consumption of fewer calories while avoiding malnutrition, was applied as a robust method of decelerating aging and the development of age-related diseases.\n\nStrategies for engineered negligible senescence\n\nThe biomedical gerontologist Aubrey de Grey has initiated a project, strategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS), to study how to reverse the damage caused by aging.  He has proposed seven strategies for what he calls the seven deadly sins of aging:\n Cell loss can be repaired (reversed) just by suitable exercise in the case of muscle. For other tissues it needs various growth factors to stimulate cell division, or in some cases it needs stem cells.\n Senescent cells can be removed by activating the immune system against them. Or they can be destroyed by gene therapy to introduce \"suicide genes\" that only kill senescent cells.\n Protein cross-linking can largely be reversed by drugs that break the links. But to break some of the cross-links we may need to develop enzymatic methods.\n Extracellular garbage (like amyloid) can be eliminated by vaccination that gets immune cells to \"eat\" the garbage.\n For intracellular junk we need to introduce new enzymes, possibly enzymes from soil bacteria, that can degrade the junk (lipofuscin) that our own natural enzymes cannot degrade.\n For mitochondrial mutations the plan is not to repair them but to prevent harm from the mutations by putting suitably modified copies of the mitochondrial genes into the cell nucleus by gene therapy. The mitochondrial DNA experiences a high degree of mutagenic damage because most free radicals are generated in the mitochondria. A copy of the mitochondrial DNA located in the nucleus will be better protected from free radicals, and there will be better DNA repair when damage occurs. All mitochondrial proteins would then be imported into the mitochondria.\n For cancer (the most lethal consequence of mutations) the strategy is to use gene therapy to delete the genes for telomerase and to eliminate telomerase-independent mechanisms of turning normal cells into \"immortal\" cancer cells. To compensate for the loss of telomerase in stem cells we would introduce new stem cells every decade or so.\nIn 2009, Aubrey de Grey co-founded the SENS Foundation to expedite progress in the above-listed areas.\n\nScientific journal\n Rejuvenation Research Editor: Aubrey de Grey.
